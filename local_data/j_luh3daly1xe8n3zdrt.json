        "subtitle": "John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",
        "date": "December 20, 2023",
        "description": "AimEndometrial cancer is diagnosed by obtaining uterine biopsies by pipelle, dilatation and curettage (D&C), or hysteroscopy. In 15%‚Äì25% of the cases, the preoperative and postoperative grades do not match. This discrepancy may carry significant clinical and prognostic consequences. We aimed to assess how body mass index (BMI) affects preoperative and postoperative grade mismatches and whether biopsy methods mitigate this effect.MethodsWe conducted a retrospective review of patients with endometrial cancer who underwent surgery at our center between 2014 and 2022. We stratified patients into six classes of BMI based on the WHO classification. Preoperative and postoperative grades were compared for concordance with regards to patient BMI and sampling method.ResultsA total of 158 patients were included, diagnosed by pipelle (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ99), hysteroscopy (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ15), or D&C (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ44). For all methods, every unit increase in BMI increased the odds of having a gap between histology grades by 5.2%. In the pipelle group, the odds of a larger gap between the histology grades was 62% higher than that of women in the other groups. Among the D&C group, the odds of having a bigger difference between histology grades were 91.8% lower compared to the other groups. Patients with BMI over 30 had nearly 50% discrepancy when diagnosed with pipelle or hysteroscopy, but less than 10% with D&C.ConclusionsIncreasing BMI is associated with decreasing concordance between preoperative and postoperative grades in endometrial cancer, especially when it exceeds 30. This effect is much less pronounced, however, when the diagnostic method is D&C."

      "Maya Erez (Haim) ‚ÄúDolev worked in the Linux storage team under my supervision for the past 3 years and had significant contribution to the team in several areas. Dolev developed various features in the UFS storage protocol, bring up of the UFS host driver on pre-silicon platforms, such as virtio and FPGA emulation. Dolev upstreamed the UFS features to the Linux kernel and was offered to serve as one of the UFS maintainers, a role he couldn‚Äôt take due to his high degree studies. During his studies, Dolev moved to the File Systems team and became the focal point for UBI-FS, performed memory consumption evaluation of UBI-FS vs YAFFS and added periodically scrubbing to UBIFS to extend the life time of the unmanaged NAND device. Dolev evaluated the performance gain of replacing the FS blocking flush requests with a barrier request, an evaluation work that required deep understanding in all the flows and storage layers. Dolev is highly innovative and often has creative ideas for improvements. During his work on UFS he issued a patent to allow SW to simultaneously send and receive I/O requests, without the need for SW locks. His excellent innovation skills were also demonstrated in his system work on extending the UFS controller standard to allow parallel connection of several hosts to a single storage device (I/O virtualization). Dolev provided good ideas for workaround of problems in UFS to allow the I/O virtualization and participated in a patent for storage I/O virtualization in collaboration with the system team. Dolev demonstrated good ability to research new domains and understand complex code, and had a unique expertise in storage performance evaluation. Dolev has excellent analytical skills and he has become a significant contributor in analysis of storage performance issues and overall performance improvements. Several examples for such tasks are development of a new block scheduling algorithm to improve UFS performance, evaluation of the Androbench storage benchmark and the I/O patterns of the overall storage stack, contribution to investigation of performance degradation when migrating to new kernel versions and many more. Dolev is a brilliant engineer, he has excellent analytical skills and innovative mind. I highly recommend him and would be happy to provide additional information via phone or email in case needed. ‚Äù"

        "title": "Identifying regulation with adversarial surrogates",
        "subtitle": "PNAS",
        "date": "March 15, 2023",
        "description": "Homeostasis, the ability to maintain a relatively constant internal environment in the face of perturbations, is a hallmark of biological systems. It is believed that this constancy is achieved through multiple internal regulation and control processes. Given observations of a system, or even a detailed model of one, it is both valuable and extremely challenging to extract the control objectives of the homeostatic mechanisms. In this work, we develop a robust data-driven method to identify these objectives, namely to understand: ‚Äúwhat does the system care about?‚Äù. We propose an algorithm, Identifying Regulation with Adversarial Surrogates (IRAS), that receives an array of temporal measurements of the system and outputs a candidate for the control objective, expressed as a combination of observed variables. IRAS is an iterative algorithm consisting of two competing players. The first player, realized by an artificial deep neural network, aims to minimize a measure of invariance we refer to as the coefficient of regulation. The second player aims to render the task of the first player more difficult by forcing it to extract information about the temporal structure of the data, which is absent from similar ‚Äúsurrogate‚Äù data. We test the algorithm on four synthetic and one natural data set, demonstrating excellent empirical results. Interestingly, our approach can also be used to extract conserved quantities, e.g., energy and momentum, in purely physical systems, as we demonstrate empirically."

        "title": "Enhancing causal estimation through unlabeled offline data",
        "subtitle": "IEEE",
        "date": "October 28, 2022",
        "description": "Classic approaches to filtering deal with real-time estimation of the hidden state of an observed system from a time-series of measurements. Model-based filtering suffers from the absence of effective utilization schemes of prior knowledge that is often available through related offline data. On the other hand, non-parametric learning-based approaches attempt to utilize offline data but are not suitable for the estimation of pre-defined hidden state parameters having meaningful physical or physiological values. Our goal is to improve the (online) filtering performance on a deployment dataset, without having access to any ground-truth values of the hidden states, but using extensively available offline measurements from related tasks. For example, in a medical application, we wish to predict the state of a patient in real time based on abundant offline information from past patients. Specifically, assume that at hand are a previously trained filter and a smoother which are both non-optimal WRT the deployment dataset. Our proposed approach consists of two stages: (i) Based on the available smoother and the set of offline measurements from the deployment data, we learn a filter that provides higher accuracy in the prediction of the hidden state variables. (ii) For any newly observed system we use the constructed filter to predict internal variables. Overall, this strategy allows us to make use of the abundantly available offline data to overcome the negative effect of a model misspecification or dataset shift. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology on a real-world task, and provide a mathematical analysis of the merits of the approach in a non-linear setting of adversarial Kalman filtering and smoothing, demonstrating its utility. As far as we are aware, this is the first method that deals with the temporal aspects of dataset shift in the temporal domain using, and extending, standard filtering/smoothing approaches."

        "title": "Explicit construction of a Barabanov norm for a class of positive planar discrete-time linear switched systems",
        "subtitle": "Automatica",
        "date": "January 1, 2012",
        "description": "We consider the stability under arbitrary switching of a discrete-time linear switched system. A powerful approach for addressing this problem is based on studying the ‚Äúmost unstable‚Äù switching law (MUSL). If the solution of the switched system corresponding to the MUSL converges to the origin, then the switched system is stable for any switching law. The MUSL can be characterized using optimal control techniques. This variational approach leads to a Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi‚ÄìBellman equation describing the behavior of the switched system under the MUSL. The solution of this equation is sometimes referred to as a Barabanov norm of the switched system. Although the Barabanov norm was studied extensively, it seems that there are few examples where it was actually computed in closed-form. In this paper, we consider a special class of positive planar discrete-time linear switched systems and provide a closed-form expression for a corresponding Barabanov norm and a MUSL. The unit circle in this norm is a parallelogram."

Moodle (acronym for modular object-oriented dynamic learning environment), is a also known as a learning management system, or virtual learning environment.Groups Select is my new Extension, doesn't exist yet in the Moodle Core Code (planned to be).It allows students to chose a group that the teacher has created for a specific course.This feautre doesn't exist yet in the Moodle Core Code, although it can be really useful in certain courses. After finding this disadvantage in moodle, I decided as my Final Project at the university, to develope this feautre. to make student's life easier, instead of being devided to groups manually or via emails."

        "date": "November 21, 2022",
        "description": "It is well known that metals are strengthened by alloying additions or finely dispersed precipitates of a second phase. Here we show that alloying pristine, defect-free single crystalline nickel nanoparticles with iron results in a counter-intuitive softening due to randomly distributed solute (Fe) atoms and nano-size precipitates of the ordered Ni3Fe or Fe-rich phases. The Ni-Fe particles with Fe concentration of 0-50 at.% were synthesized by solid-state dewetting of Ni-Fe bilayer thin films deposited on a sapphire substrate. Ni-27Fe and Ni-50Fe particles exhibited a bimodal size distribution with small (111) and large (100) oriented particles. The solid solution softening was observed in all particles. The precipitation softening was observed in (100) oriented Ni-27Fe particles with uniformly distributed ordered Ni3Fe (L12) precipitates. Fe-rich precipitates were found on the surfaces and near the edges of the highly alloyed Ni-50Fe particles, leading to even greater softening. Molecular dynamic simulations of particle deformation have demonstrated that the softening effect is associated with premature dislocation nucleation at sites with a local stress concentration caused by the randomly distributed solute atoms. This work illustrates how the classical hardening mechanisms operating in bulk materials can be manipulated and even reversed in defect-free single-crystalline metal nanoparticles whose plastic deformation is controlled by dislocation nucleation."

These injuries cause additional damages, such as burdens on the health care system and taxpayer costs estimated by billions of dollars, which are caused as a result of treatment and rehabilitation efforts.Falls can be prevented by early detection and rehabilitation of the gait pattern failures. As of today, the detection of these failures is made possible by performing a gait test which requires the patient to reach a designated laboratory.Safe Walk system is a home sensor kit combined with a web application which supports the detection of abnormal events in the patient's gait pattern, alerts the relevant parties of a failures diagnosis, presents relevant data for an in-depth understanding of the root cause of the problem, creates a rehabilitation program for the patient and continues to monitor its progress."

      "Tom Winter ‚ÄúI had the pleasure of working with Niv as his Site Manager at Autodesk Israel for four years. During that time, I witnessed Niv transition seamlessly between various departments, consistently demonstrating his ability to make a positive impact wherever he went. Niv's greatest strength lies in his exceptional people skills. He possesses a unique talent for forging strong connections with diverse stakeholders, ranging from his own team in Israel to the expansive, 50 global product teams, and extending all the way to customers across the globe. This ability to collaborate effectively allows him to excel in any environment. Niv actively seeked opportunities to contribute even beyond his role. He took on numerous responsibilities that positively influenced the culture of our Israeli site. In some cases, Niv's initiatives impacted multi-regional product teams in both methods of product work and collaboration. I highly recommend Niv to anyone seeking a capable, adaptable, and people-oriented individual who can thrive in any collaborative environment. His strong work ethic, exceptional communication skills, and passion for building relationships make him a great asset to any team.‚Äù",
      "Amit Ashkenazi ‚ÄúNiv is one of the best product managers I've ever had the pleasure of working with. Not only is Niv super smart and sharp, but he is also one of the most dedicated and reliable professionals I've seen. Niv and I have worked very closely together over the years, and I am proud to say that we have become great friends which is not at all obvious and make our work together far more enjoyable. His work ethic and leadership skills have been a constant inspiration to me, and I have no doubt that he would be an asset to any team or project. What I admire most about Niv is his ability to \"get it.\" He has an innate understanding of complex processes and is always able to find creative solutions to challenging problems. He is dedicated to his work and always goes above and beyond to ensure that projects are completed successfully. Even more impressive is Niv's ability to communicate with clients. It is rare to find a product manager who can connect with clients on such a personal level, but Niv manages to do so with ease. I have seen him work with Fortune 500 companies with very challenging needs, and he always manages to exceed their expectations. He is truly an exceptional professional, a great friend and colleague, and imply an outstanding individual who will undoubtedly bring value to any team he works with.‚Äù"

      "Naomi Fleisher ‚ÄúI was recently fortunate to work closely with Esther on a company-wide dev testing initiative and to consult with her as the senior developer on our first cross product-dev agile team to go through the pilot of our training. I've always been impressed by Esther's technical know-how and willingness to help out with even the most challenging of projects; but as a quality professional I was particularly struck by her commitment to the highest quality product while hitting fast paced goals, keeping specs clear and keeping her team aligned and rallied. She confidently meets any technical challenge necessary head on and goes above and beyond to achieve fantastic results for the client and for her team. In the game of software development she is an all-star. Congrats to the company that snags her. ‚Äù",
      "Michelle Konig ‚ÄúI worked with Esther since the moment I was hired, she was from the beginning very welcoming and such an easy person to with. Shortly after I started working in HomeTalk she became the senior developer of our team and it was amazing to see her growth and ownership plus engaging in part of the team managment. She did such an incredible job, always keeping the positive spirit of team, she made sure that everyone knew how important they were and how appreciative she was for everyone efforts. She was always available and helping out for both team members and other workers. A great team player, organized and thorough are just some of the words that I can describe Esther as a worker but also due to her kind and honest personality I can gladily say that today we have also became friends. I can only thank her for a huge learning experience and such great day to day companion to work with!‚Äù"

Omer, as well as his Co-Founder & CTO, both served with me in Maglan (IDF Special Forces Commando Unit), once again family. 3. Omer has a deep understanding of the eCommerce market which he is looking to disrupt & address the shortfalls which he experienced first hand, which lead him to create Price Backers. 4.

We have been partners throughout our entire B.Sc degree, and have spent countless hours dealing with everything the Technion had to throw at us, Starting with the early days of the \"Introduction to computer science\" course during our first semester when we drew triangles using nested loops in the C language, and onto winning Hackathon competitions and our taking on complex projects and solving real-world problems in machine learning, statistical analysis and natural language processing. Guy is an outstanding programmer and one of the sharpest algorithmic minds I have ever had a chance to work with. He is highly driven at everything he does and has an outstanding work ethic and unrelenting desire to deliver results. As someone who has executed numerous projects beside him, I can truthfully testify he is a great team player, flexible and open minded to dynamic changes and fresh ideas, and a good friend. I'm confident in Guy's ability to have a positive impact on any team he will be a member of, and offer my strong recommendation.‚Äù"

Sharon is a sharp, talented, experienced and fun person to work with! She has lead employee recruitment, retention, well-being, compensation planning... and much more - HR from end to end. I am confident every organization will be fortunate to have Sharon as a leader in its team.‚Äù",
      "Opher Dubrovsky ‚ÄúI've worked with Sharon as a counterpart for 1 1/2 years at Ceedo Technologies where I was the VP of marketing and product management and Sharon was the HR manager. Sharon always had a great read of the organization and what was going on. She brought insight into the human factor aspect and the informal processes going on to our management meetings leading to better decision making and activity focus. Sharon kicked off multiple initiatives that helped build a strong organization and coached us through them. I found myself consulting with her on how to push forward various activities I was involved in from pushing for quicker software development to growing key people in my team. On the hiring side, Sharon was instrumental in examining recruits and had a vital influence on the hiring decision, leading to quality recruitments. She helped me recruit a product manager who turned out to be a pleasure to work with and had a very positive effect on the team. I highly recommend Sharon as a great addition to any team, and would love to work with her again if circumstances permit.‚Äù"

      "Snir Hassin ‚ÄúRarely in my years of experience, managing over 200 different people, i've seen someone who contains the \"full package\" of features so early in his career. \"Full package\" as in the broadest you can imagine - leadership skills, presentability, super smart, excellent human skills, hungry for revenues, hard worker and impressively knowledgeable. After a few months we understood we had to open Liad a Fast track career route and i can honestly say, we'll now need to check ourselves to understand how our organization let someone like Liad go. You'll be lucky to hire him, and you'll be even luckier to have him around.‚Äù"

        "subtitle": "pre-print",
        "date": "August 11, 2020",
        "description": "Fast matrix multiplication algorithms may be useful, provided that their running time is good in practice. Particularly, the leading coefficient of their arithmetic complexity needs to be small. Many sub-cubic algorithms have large leading coefficients, rendering them impractical. Karstadt and Schwartz (SPAA'17, JACM'20) demonstrated how to reduce these coefficients by sparsifying an algorithm's bilinear operator. Unfortunately, the problem of finding optimal sparsifications is NP-Hard.We obtain three new methods to this end, and apply them to existing fast matrix multiplication algorithms, thus improving their leading coefficients. These methods have an exponential worst case running time, but run fast in practice and improve the performance of many fast matrix multiplication algorithms. Two of the methods are guaranteed to produce leading coefficients that, under some assumptions, are optimal.An earlier version of this paper was presented at a workshop during SIAM CSC'2020."

        "date": "July 24, 2017",
        "description": "Strassen's algorithm (1969) was the first sub-cubic matrix multiplication algorithm. Winograd (1971) improved its complexity by a constant factor. Many asymptotic improvements followed. Unfortunately, most of them have done so at the cost of very large, often gigantic, hidden constants. Consequently, Strassen-Winograd's O(nlog27) algorithm often outperforms other matrix multiplication algorithms for all feasible matrix dimensions. The leading coefficient of Strassen-Winograd's algorithm was believed to be optimal for matrix multiplication algorithms with 2x2 base case, due to a lower bound of Probert (1976).Surprisingly, we obtain a faster matrix multiplication algorithm, with the same base case size and asymptotic complexity as Strassen-Winograd's algorithm, but with the coefficient reduced from 6 to 5. To this end, we extend Bodrato's (2010) method for matrix squaring, and transform matrices to an alternative basis. We prove a generalization of Probert's lower bound that holds under change of basis, showing that for matrix multiplication algorithms with a 2x2 base case, the leading coefficient of our algorithm cannot be further reduced, hence optimal. We apply our technique to other Strassen-like algorithms, improving their arithmetic and communication costs by significant constant factors."

Meytal has worked with me on several products, and always encouraged me to do everything on the best way. On one hand, she did not compromised on code standard and quality and on the other hand, she completely understands the business' needs, and she is having a business-first approach. Meytal's achievements as a software developer, made her a valuable player in our field. I'm sure she'll be an asset to the next organization she joins.‚Äù",
      "Chen Gazit ‚ÄúWorking with Meytal was great experience for me. What I like about Meytal is that she is not afraid of anything, and her ability of learning new technologies, as well as investigate and understand how things actually work, and most of all how she is facing challenges & complex problems is just inspiring. I think that Meytal is a gift for every R&D team, and I wish to work with her again in the future.‚Äù"

        "title": "Calibrated Viewability Prediction for¬†Premium Inventory Expansion",
        "subtitle": "springer",
        "description": "Billions of ads are displayed on a daily basis, making it a multi-billion industry. Most of web pages contain multiple ads, which are largely served in real time using a bidding process where buyers (advertisers) offer a price tag to the seller (publishers) for each given possible ad on the page. There are multiple factors that impact an ad price, one of the primary ones is the ad-location‚Äôs viewability likelihood. Due to the length of many web pages, certain ad locations are invisible to the visiting user, as he may not scroll far enough on the page to where the ads are placed. According to recent industry metrics, less than 60% of ads are viewable. This poses a challenge to both: buyers and sellers. Buyers want to optimize the likelihood they buy an ad that will be viewed, while sellers want to maximize ad prices (by setting higher floor prices) by providing as many possible ad placements with high viewability probability. This paper addresses the viewability prediction from the publisher‚Äôs side, and proposes a novel algorithm based on cascading gradient boosting. The algorithm enables sellers to predict an accurate viewability probability for ad impressions, which is optimized to match the actual viewability rate that will be measured for the served ads. Unlike other algorithms that optimize these problems to an average minimal difference from a central mean error, we propose an algorithm that increases the amount of extreme cases - which are the most valuable ones, thus expanding the premium ad inventory. We evaluate the algorithm on two datasets with a total of over 500 million impressions. We found that the algorithm outperforms other viewability prediction algorithms, works well for publishers while providing a measurable fairness metric to advertisers."

        "title": "Forecasting CPI Inflation Components with Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks",
        "description": "We present a hierarchical architecture based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for predicting disaggregated inflation components of the Consumer Price Index (CPI). While the majority of existing research is focused on predicting headline inflation, many economic and financial institutions are interested in its partial disaggregated components. To this end, we developed the novel Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Network (HRNN) model, which utilizes information from higher levels in the CPI hierarchy to improve predictions at the more volatile lower levels. Based on a large dataset from the US CPI-U index, our evaluations indicate that the HRNN model significantly outperforms a vast array of well-known inflation prediction baselines. Our methodology and results provide additional forecasting measures and possibilities to policy and market makers on sectoral and component-specific price changes"

      "Erez Lidor ‚ÄúI've had the privilege of working with Nir for almost 3 years, and the pleasure of seeing his growth during this time. Nir is one of the best R&D Group Managers I've worked with during my years in the industry, and if I have to attribute it to one quality, it is thanks to his ability to learn, change and grow. Nir has very strong technical skills, and the ability (and wish) to keep enhancing them. Whenever his teams went into new technological areas, he took it upon him to get into the new stuff, in order to continue being a technical authority, all while managing large development groups. Nir is a great manager - truly interested in his people, what drives them and what assistance they need from him in order to succeed. He has demonstrated his ability to recruit new teams quickly and bring them up-to-speed successfully. Top that with him being a funny, humble, honest and down-to-earth person, and you can see why Nir is someone you really want to manage your R&D group, whether you're his CEO, VP, one of his peers or one of his employees.‚Äù",
      "Mati Cohen ‚ÄúI had the pleasure of working with Nir while in Panaya. Nir always understood what the product should do, providing great solutions based both on algorithms and engineering. He is loved by his teams, colleagues and peers. A great leader by example and a true friend to hang out with. I would highly recommend anyone to work with Nir. ‚Äù"

        "date": "October 7, 2012",
        "description": "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is considered to be most common among children and adolescents and has been extensively investigated in the field of psychiatry and neurology. Nevertheless, the psychodynamic understanding of ADHD is still relatively limited. This study explored the psychoanalytic construct of schizoid-paranoid position (Klein, 1935) in a sample of 22 adolescents aged 11-18 who report ADHD symptoms, as compared to non ADHD normative adolescents (Tibon, Rothschild & Appel, 2012), by using Rorschach Comprehensive System (CS; Exner, 2003) variables assumed to measure personality functioning in which this position dominares. The study also made use of the Personal relatedness profile (PRP; Hobson, Patrick and Valentine, 1998) which was translated into Hebrew for the purposes of this research project. This instrument refers to the three characteristics of the schizoid-paranoid position (a) the quality of object relations, (b) degree of subjectivity (I-ness) and (c) ability to symbolize (Klein, 1935, Ogden, 1984). The correlations between the CS and the PRP variables were found to be significant. As has been hypothesized, the ADHD group showed schizoid-paranoid dominancy in both the CS and the PRP scale. These findings contribute to the psychodynamic understanding of ADHD."

      "Gal Ziv ‚ÄúFrom my very beginning at the IDF, and for over two years, I have worked side by side with Moshe on the same project. Moshe, as a more senior developer tutored me in a new programming language (C#) and into a new and challenging job and project. During this period Moshe has demonstrated high-level programming skills, had a well-explained answer to every question I had and was a true role model. Also, Moshe had always been a great friend and, with his supreme social skills, helped me with pleasure during tough personal events. To summarize, if you want a great professional, serious developer with great emotional intelligence and presence - the total package, Moshe is your guy! ‚Äù",
      "Uriel Zylbermann ‚ÄúI've known Moshe for a while before we worked together, but during the 3 years we were on the same team I met a highly motivated, highly talented software engineer. Moshe has improved every project he has worked on, and could always take the high level design into account without losing sight of the small details. Any team would be lucky to have Moshe, both as an engineer and as a manager.‚Äù"

      "Meryl Feinberg ‚ÄúI was fortunate to have worked closely with Avichay for 7 ¬Ω years while at SmarTeam. As a member of his marketing team for 2 ¬Ω years, I benefited greatly from Avichay‚Äôs deep and evolving knowledge of the market we were working in and the standards of excellence that he set for any project being worked on. In my role of Corporate Planning I continued to work closely with Avichay and always appreciated his opinion and support. Avichay truly cared about his employees and their professional advancement. Although he was a co-founder of the company and a senior level manager, I always felt that I could turn to him whether to resolve a challenge I was facing, get input on a project I was working on or simply brainstorm high-level messages and corporate directions. He receives my highest endorsement and I would be thrilled to work with him again in the future.‚Äù"

We worked together on several important projects. I knew I could trust her with anything! She always had wonderful and out-of-the-box ideas, a can-do attitude and she creates a fun work environment. Aviv delivers superb design work, intuitive UX flows and visually appealing UI elements.‚Äù",
      "Coral Cohen ‚ÄúAviv is one of the most creative designers I've had the pleasure to work with. She expertly filled the role of a UX designer on Playtika's Solitaire Grand Harvest game, and very quickly felt like she was always part of the team (socially and creative). I was very impressed by her ability to handle any challenge that came her way. Aviv would be an asset to any team! For further details about her role, or any questions please feel free to contact me‚Äù"

Upon returning to their saved form, users will be directed to the exact point they last visited, eliminating the need to restart from the beginning. This feature enhances user convenience and accommodates varying time constraints.Effortless Changes Implementation:The redesigned form architecture allows for swift and seamless implementation of changes. No more grappling with the challenges posed by the previous system, where each modification demanded extensive effort.Bug-Resistant Ordering Process:The updated form guarantees a streamlined and more bug-resistant ordering process for both our customers and internal teams.Results:The adoption of this improved process has garnered positive feedback from our users. The heightened satisfaction is a testament to our commitment to delivering not just products, but exceptional experiences."

I've also learned how to build a transformation strategy.During the project, I've performed an analysis of our business priorities, the company's org‚Äôs readiness to transition, and our technical strategy.We've educated our company about the rollout strategy, including presentations to our executives that outlined the ROI of moving to Lightning Experience, plus the scope, timeline, and cost of the project. We shared Lightning Experience with key stakeholders and demonstrated how they can benefit from the transformation.We have performed the implementations and managed our developers who worked on some code adjustments.I've created training materials (videos and guides) in order to increase the users' adoption, and we've provided hands-on training to our key users, so they will be able to pass their knowledge to their teams.We have tested the changes in our test environments, along with our key users, and made changes, as needed.We've communicated the project implications, as well as the deployment date, to all of the teams involved, and to all of the relevant end-users.Summary:We've Improved the UX, UI, and productivity by moving 90% of the users to Lightning Experience (our community users are still in classic).There is still much to be done since change isn't always easy for some people, but we are very satisfied with the change that was made and the overall adoption."

In addition, I've managed our Salesforce developers in order to adjust Apex Classes. During that time, I've fixed the data of millions of records.Before I've enabled the Country and State picklists, I've communicated the project implications, as well as the deployment date, to all of the teams involved, and also to end-users.The project was successfully deployed to our Production environment without any major problems.

        "description": "The Problem:* Common admin procedures were not documented* Metadata changes or new Metadata developments and implementations were barely documentedWithout documentation, the Salesforce Admins found it hard to perform repetitive procedures. In addition, when the Salesforce Admin tried to solve a process issue, they found it very hard to understand who created the process, why he did it, and how. They didn't even know which component is a part of which process.The Solution:I've created a new custom object that allows Admins to:1. Document procedures - admins are now able to document Salesforce admins' procedures with ease. 2. Document Changes - admins are now able to document changes. They can explain the reason/requirements for the change, and elaborate on what their solution was. We can attach documents on every record, and communicate with other admins through Chatter.The solution I've implemented allows us, the admins, to perform procedures without forgetting anything. It allows us to make fewer mistakes. We also have a clear understanding of how our org operates.Now, all of our essential information and processes are in one, easy-to-access place."

      "Avi Yehuda ‚ÄúIlya served as a software developer, and as such his main responsibility was to develop and maintain a comprehensive system composing the company‚Äôs product line platform. Ilya served as a focal point for key projects and technologies. Ilya's tasks would sometimes include high-priority-last-minute requests, and carried them out while meeting the deadlines, even if that would mean staying extra long hours. I wish Ilya the best of luck, and I am confident that his skills will be put to great use in his next position.‚Äù",
      "Doron Gill ‚ÄúIlya is an excellent software engineer, well versed in the art of software design and coding. Ilya's work at Neocleus was epitomized by very complex low-level projects which required very intense research and pin-point accuracy implementation. Those projects were executed on time, and the code he turned in was very clean. On the personal front, Ilya was very much respected and liked by his peers. He was always there to lend a hand when needed.‚Äù"

        "date": "2017",
        "description": "We present an improved three-step pipeline for the stereo matching problem and introduce multiple novelties at each stage. We propose a new highway network architecture for computing the matching cost at each possible disparity, based on multilevel weighted residual shortcuts, trained with a hybrid loss that supports multilevel comparison of image patches. A novel post-processing step is then introduced, which employs a second deep convolutional neural network for pooling global information from multiple disparities. This network outputs both the image disparity map, which replaces the conventional \"winner takes all\" strategy, and a confidence in the prediction. The confidence score is achieved by training the network with a new technique that we call the reflective loss. Lastly, the learned confidence is employed in order to better detect outliers in the refinement step. The proposed pipeline achieves state of the art accuracy on the largest and most competitive stereo benchmarks, and the learned confidence is shown to outperform all existing alternatives."

He is a highly skilled and talented individual with a wealth of experience in quality assurance and automation. He always impressed me with his attention to detail, proficiency in automated software testing and ability to create effective test plans and cases. Alex's knowledge in Elasticsearch, Docker, Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) and TypeScript made him an invaluable asset to the team and the company. He is a great team player, always willing to share his knowledge and expertise with colleagues, and a pleasure to work with. He always told it like it was and has a great sense of humor. I highly recommend Alex for any role in QA & Automation.‚Äù"

      "Leav Graves ‚ÄúI started working with David in Dividend Investments Inc (Tavor). where he help me create a tool to predict future cash-flow for clients' bond portfolio. This tool was unique in the Israeli investment realm and proven to be very not only useful in our daily work, but also help our communication with our clients as it was easier to explain the methodology, scenarios, constraints and more. Lately David helps and consults us with building derivative vol surfaces and financial models for the equity-options realm. David has a vast knowledge in financial models and is well verse in the tools and methodologies that allow him to build financial models from start to finish. He is well versed in economics, statistics and the technical tools to execute the models such as VBA, C# and SQL. ‚Äù",
      "Oren Mizrachi ‚ÄúDavid was the first team member that I recruited to work in my team of QA analysts. Leveraging on his strong analytical skills and his education and hands-on experience in statistics, VBA, C# and SQL David greatly helped in the design and creation of the QA tools that eventually were used by the team to perform its core tasks. David's out of the box thinking and uncompromising nature are undoubtedly real assets to any role that involves establishment of new working processes and tools. He is a pleasure to work with and made many friends while working in my team. David is a team player and I would definitely recommend him for any team that is facing complex challenges.‚Äù"

      "Valentin (Binyamin) Vasquez ‚ÄúI have known and worked with Yoav for many years, in different groups and structures. He is a very strong asset for any organization: highly professional, out-of-the-box thinker, dedicated and meticulous, Yoav leads all tasks with the highest standards, gives strong results and exceeds expectations. He always takes initiatives and he is one of the must trustworthy person I had the chance to work with. Very technical, Yoav can lead and bring to reality complicated product/solutions projects as well as will ensure the success of any customer-facing activity.‚Äù",
      "Adam Kaplan ‚ÄúYoav is a true professional asset: reliable, conscientious, and laser focused on getting the job done. Yoav and I first worked together on sponsorship and organizational fundraising for events for the veteran's association \"Frogmen Wave Challenge\", and more recently in a sales capacity for Meprolight. Yoav is skilled in bridging the international communications gap, being as comfortable working in the North American professional sector as with the Israeli sphere (which was critical in the organization's success). What stood out was Yoav's ability to inspire confidence in the organization's strategic plan (and more importantly, in the ability to execute that plan). Simply put, if you're looking for a stellar client-facing international business professional, Yoav is your guy. ‚Äù"

      "Oren Geva ‚ÄúHadas is an intelligent, dedicated and professional HR business partner and manager. I have worked with Hadas for almost two years at Veeva, and have nothing but praise to describe her work. First, as a new employee (albeit a rather senior one), she helped my onboarding and orientation process in the company with professional knowledge and a human touch. Then, as a manager in the company she was my partner in managing, designing, envisioning and executing our HR vision and policy. With her approachable character she was the go to person for all our employees and always catered for their needs and while balancing individual and the company goals. She takes her work seriously - this is evident in the sense of total ownership, deep care and dedication she has. But she always keeps on a wide smile and an easily approachable availability for all employees to reach out. As the sole HRBP in the IL office, she practically led this domain in our office, providing invaluable value to the management team and all employees. She was involved in all aspects of HR in the office - from hiring and benefits, through manager mentoring and new employee onboarding to being a key member of the site leadership. I recommend her heartily for any HR role, she can do it all!‚Äù",
      "LinkedIn User ‚ÄúHadas was the talent partner for our office, supported us in all the HR requirements, helped us recruit, train and maintain a high morale.

        "date": "February 21, 2022",
        "description": "Background: Difficulty in modulating multisensory input, specifically the sensory over-responsive (SOR) type, is linked to pain hypersensitivity and anxiety, impacting daily function and quality of life in children and adults. Reduced cortical activity recorded under resting state has been reported, suggestive of neuromodulation as a potential therapeutic modality. This feasibility study aimed to explore neurofeedback intervention in SOR. Methods: Healthy women with SOR (n = 10) underwent an experimental feasibility study comprising four measurement time points (T1‚Äîbaseline; T2‚Äîpreintervention; T3‚Äîpostintervention; T4‚Äîfollow-up). Outcome measures included resting-state EEG recording, in addition to behavioral assessments of life satisfaction, attaining functional goals, pain sensitivity, and anxiety. Intervention targeted the upregulation of alpha oscillatory power over ten sessions. Results: No changes were detected in all measures between T1 and T2. Exploring the changes in brain activity between T2 and T4 revealed power enhancement in delta, theta, beta, and gamma oscillatory bands, detected in the frontal region (p = 0.03‚Äì<0.001; Cohen‚Äôs d = 0.637‚Äì1.126) but not in alpha oscillations. Furthermore, a large effect was found in enhancing life satisfaction and goal attainment (Cohen‚Äôs d = 1.18; 1.04, respectively), and reduced pain sensitivity and anxiety trait (Cohen‚Äôs d = 0.70). Conclusion: This is the first study demonstrating the feasibility of neurofeedback intervention in SOR."

        "description": "Background: Digital technologies have the potential to provide objective and precise tools to detect depression-related symptoms. Deployment of digital technologies in clinical research can enable collection of large volumes of clinically relevant data that may not be captured using conventional psychometric questionnaires and patient-reported outcomes. Objective: We conducted an exploratory, cross-sectional study to evaluate several digital technologies in subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) and persistent depressive disorder (PDD), and healthy controls. The study aimed at assessing utility and accuracy of the digital technologies as potential diagnostic tools for unipolar depression, as well as correlating digital biomarkers to clinically validated psychometric questionnaires in depression.Methods: A cross-sectional, non-interventional study of 20 participants with unipolar depression (MDD and PDD/dysthymia) and 20 healthy controls was conducted at the Centre for Human Drug Research (CHDR), the Netherlands. Four technologies were evaluated in the clinic: a neuropsychological test battery; an eye motor tracking system; a standard high-density electroencephalogram (EEG)-based technology to analyze the brain network activity during cognitive testing; and a task quantifying bias in emotion perception.Results: Our data analysis was organized by technology ‚Äì to better understand individual features of various technologies. In many cases, we obtained simple, parsimonious models that have reasonably high diagnostic accuracy and potential to predict standard clinical outcome in depression.Conclusion: This study generated many useful insights for future methodology studies of digital technologies and proof-of-concept clinical trials in depression and possibly other indications."

EEG data were collected from ten individuals with 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome (14‚Äì18 years of age), as well as thirty age-matched healthy controls, as the subjectsresponded to Auditory Oddball (AOB) and Go/NoGo cognitive tasks. It was determined that BNA can be used to evaluate cognitive function in 15q13.3 microdeletion patients. This analysis also significantly differentiates between patient and control groups using 5 scores, all of which are BNA-Based produced from ERP peaks related to late cortical components that represent higher cognitive functions of attention allocation and response inhibition (P < 0.05)."

        "date": "February 15, 2019",
        "description": "Electroencephalography (EEG)-based neurofeedback (NF) is a safe, non-invasive, non-painful method for treating various conditions. Current NF systems enable the selection of only one NF parameter, so that two parameters cannot be feedback simultaneously. Consequently, the ability to individually-tailor the treatment to a patient is limited, and treatment efficiency may therefore be compromised. We aimed to design, implement and test an all-in-one, novel, computerized platform for closed-loop NF treatment, based on principles from learning theories. Our prototype performs numeric evaluation based on quantifying resting EEG and event-related EEG responses to various sensory stimuli. The NF treatment was designed according to principles of efficient learning, and implemented as a gradual, patient-adaptive 1D or 2D computer game, that utilizes automatic EEG feature extraction. Verification was performed as we compared the mean area under curve (AUC) of the theta band of a dozen subjects staring at a wall or performing the NF. Most of the subjects (75%) increased their theta band AUC during the NF session compared with the trial staring at the wall (p = 0.041). Our system enables multiple feature selection and its machine learning capabilities allow an accurate discovery of patient-specific biomarkers and treatment targets. Its novel characteristics may allow for improved evaluation of patients and treatment outcomes."

Other benchmarks, like ImageNet-O, are heavily biased towards the specific model that was used to collect samples into it (see the attached graph). Furthermore, these benchmarks represent the same difficulty level for OOD detectors.We propose a novel technique to generate a C-OOD benchmark that covers a variety of difficulty levels. Unlike other existing benchmarks, our technique is not biased towards an arbitrary model and/or a specific confidence function\\detection technique such as the softmax response. This means our technique can be used to reliably benchmark any combination of model and detection technique (e.g., ODIN, MC Dropout, etc.).We proceed to evaluate 500+ ImageNet-1k classifiers for their C-OOD detection performance. We make numerous novel observations. To name a few:1. ViT models, when trained with specific regimes, can outperform any other model or technique observed by a wide margin.2. Knowledge distillation is the training regime that consistently improves all evaluated metrics the most.3. The language‚Äìvision CLIP model achieves good zero-shot C-OOD detection performance.4. The best combination of (model, detection technique) should be optimized for the required difficulty of the OOD data."

To name a few, we find that distillation-based training regimes consistently yield better uncertainty estimations than other training schemes such as vanilla training, pretraining on a larger dataset and adversarial training. Moreover, we find a subset of ViT models that outperform any other models in terms of uncertainty estimation performance.ùêïùê¢ùêùùêûùê® ùê≠ùêöùê•ùê§:https://lnkd.in/djpgA6AfùêíùêÆùê¶ùê¶ùêöùê´ùê≤:We evaluate 500+ ImageNet-1k classifiers for their uncertainty estimation performance, i.e., ranking (AUROC), calibration (ECE) and selective performance. We make numerous novel observations. To name a few:1. Knowledge distillation is the training regime that consistently improves uncertainty estimation performance the most. This remains true even when the teacher itself is much worse at uncertainty estimation.2. Several training regimes result in a subset of ViTs that outperforms all other architectures and training regimes.3. Contrary to previous work, we observe that while there is a strong correlation between accuracy/number of parameters and ECE or AUROC within each specific family of models of the same architecture, the correlation flips between a strong negative and a strong positive correlation depending on the type of architecture being observed.4. Temperature scaling, a post-training calibration method that is known to improve calibration (ECE), for the most part also improves ranking (AUROC) and selective prediction. This fact was previously unknown. Additionally, we find that while temperature scaling is usually beneficial, it could harm some models, even in terms of calibration."

        "description": "ùêìùêãùêÉùêë: Rather than attacking a neural network's accuracy, we have devised ACE, an algorithm that attacks its uncertainty estimation performance without harming its accuracy, making it confident in its incorrect predictions and uncertain about its correct predictions.ùêíùêÆùê¶ùê¶ùêöùê´ùê≤:In this paper, we present our novel method for directly and solely attacking the uncertainty estimation performance of deep neural networks. We call our method ACE: Attack on Confidence Estimation.While most (if not all) standard adversarial attacks target the accuracy of neural networks, ACE instead only disrupts their uncertainty estimation performance without harming their accuracy. As a result, after using ACE, neural networks become very confident in their incorrect predictions and unconfident in their correct ones.In this paper, ACE is applied to a variety of uncertainty estimation techniques, including Softmax, MC Dropout, Deep Ensembles, and SelectiveNet.ùêáùê®ùê∞ ùêúùêöùêß ùêÄùêÇùêÑ ùê°ùêöùê´ùê¶ ùê¢ùê≠ùê¨ ùêØùê¢ùêúùê≠ùê¢ùê¶?:When deep neural networks are used for applications with a low tolerance for risk, such as medical applications in which incorrect predictions could mean life or death, they must employ an uncertainty estimation mechanism to better manage their risk, such as selective prediction.In its simplest form, selective prediction would, for example, set a threshold on a model's softmax score such that the model abstains from making predictions whose confidence does not exceed this threshold. A mechanism such as this may greatly improve the model's accuracy on the predictions it hasn't abstained from.This relies on the assumption, which usually holds true, that neural networks assign higher confidence to correct predictions than they do to incorrect ones. However, ACE (our algorithm) makes this assumption invalid, rendering uncertainty estimates useless. Relying on them would only harm the accuracy of the model."

      "LinkedIn User ‚ÄúI've collaborated with Ortal in multiple projects and companies, where she served as both my peer and manager. She is a true \"mountain mover\", and one of the most potent professionals I came across. Ortal's high level skills and vast experience in software development makes her the ideal manager in a start-up environment. Leading complex projects, she has an astonishing ability to ask the right questions, achieve full comprehension, and make clear cut decisions that drive products forward. Even in the face of the most difficult challenge and the tightest of schedules ‚Äì Ortal keeps her calm, methodically breaks down the problem, and comes out on top each and every time. As a manager, Ortal holds herself to the highest standard. She navigates according to her own moral compass and personal judgement of what's best for the company, and never lets politics or personal interests interfere with her team's progress. A rarity in the start-up scene, she truly cares about the individuals in her team, and goes to great lengths to enhance their skills and motivation. She does not miss a chance to promote the accomplishments of her people, nor does she shy away from giving harsh-but-crucial feedback in a constructive manner. Her approach wins her the trust and commitment of her employees, who will put in the extra hours and effort in return. On a personal level, Ortal is my go-to person for any managerial or interpersonal dilemma. Her charm and authentic care for those around her makes it easy for her to gain the friendship of all. Ortal is as good as they get, and I have no doubt we'll collaborate again in the future.‚Äù",
      "Dotan Snir ‚ÄúOrtal was my direct manager for almost 3 years. During this time, she managed a group of 10 product and project managers, that was responsible for the company‚Äôs core business. Ortal has a remarkable ability to see the overall picture in addition to the technical complexity of the projects she has managed. It was especially helpful when she needed to work around a problem and focus on the desired goals. Ortal speaks both the technical and business lingo. She did an extraordinary job engaging the technical people with the business ones, all the way up to C-level. Ortal has a great understanding of the user‚Äôs requests and needs and a proven experience of how to translate them into product features with proven ROI. As my direct manager, Ortal always knew how to challenge me and share her vast experience and knowledge in a generous way, while simultaneously granting her team the trust and space necessary to do their jobs effectively. Ortal is always accommodating, understanding and trustworthy which makes her a great manager and a pleasant person to work with. ‚Äù"

The analysis for discovering the requirements of the intended system was based on gathering information about the proposed and other existing systems and then distilling the user and system requirements from this information. Discussing and analyzing some of the state-of-the-art motion tracking systems, addressing their deficiencies along with stressing their advantages and disadvantages help us bypass difficulties and problems that might occur with our system. Some theoretical issues necessary to develop our low-cost tracking system is shown. In a further step, the detailed implementation of this system consisting of hardware ingredients and algorithms is presented. Finally, outstanding issues and future directions for further investigation are suggested."

      "Lior Shagan ‚ÄúI can comfortably say that Ariel is the one of the best Scrum Master I've worked with so far in my career. Having worked on several projects under his management, including the successful launch of new line of products, I've found him to be a professional, dedicated, loyal and skilled Scrum master who went to great lengths to ensure the best outcome for his projects. In particular, as a QA, I valued Ariel ability to shield his development team from all the political side of the projects and allowed them to focus on the development work. He kept unnecessary meetings to a minimum and always supported his DEVS&QA when inevitable difficult situations arose. This allowed us to work well as a team and ensured the success of our projects. Alongside that, Ariel was always upbeat and positive, brought a lot of energy to his work and was fun to be around in the office. ‚Äù",
      "Shirly Ronen-Harel ‚ÄúI had a great pleasure working with Ariel for the last 6 months during an agile implementation that took place in Salestech. Ariel lead a group of scrum teams through this journey of agile implementation to a higher level and a great success. Ariel managed to build an excellent and empowered team of professionals integrating developers and s testers. Ariel team delivered! Ariel is a hardworking, results oriented and practical individual. He turned to be an amazing scrum master, with a good leadership skills and a healthy agile mindset. I hope to work with him in the future. ‚Äù"

        "description": "Bearing failure is one of the major causes of breakdown in rotating machinery. One of the key challenges in bearing diagnostics and prognostics is to detect the defect as early as possible, when the failure signs are weak.Vibration based early detection of bearing failure requires improvement of the signal to noise ratio by an effective signal de-noising and extraction of the weak failure signs that can be obscured by other vibration sources and noise. The challenge is to enhance the weak signature in the early stages of defect development.The task of enhancing the weak failure signs is complicated by the fact that changes in operating conditions influence vibrations sources and change the mixture recorded by the sensors. As a result, the recorded signal becomes non-stationary. The proposed technique suggests a solution to that problem. The technique adapts the basic dephase method to analysis of non-stationary signals recorded from a system operating under changing operating conditions.The adapted dephase method was applied to vibrations measured in rotating machinery, including systems with healthy bearings and damaged bearings. The same feature extraction procedure was applied to signatures in the orders domain before and after the application of the adapted dephase. The results show the effectiveness of the method for diagnosis both in the orders representation and in the orders of the envelope representation."

        "description": "Detection of damaged mechanical components in their early stages is crucial in many applications. The diagnostic of mechanical components is achieved most effectively using vibration and/or acoustical measurements sometimes accompanied by oil debris indications. The paper describes a concept for fusion and decision for mechanical components based on vibro-acoustic signatures. The typical situation in diagnostic of complex machinery is existence of large number of records from normally operating machinery and few recordings with damaged components, where diagnostic of each component requires consideration of large number of features. The proposed system solves the problem by introducing a hierarchical decision scheme implemented in layers imitating expert‚Äôs decision reasoning. The architecture and tools used allow incorporation of expert‚Äôs knowledge along with the ability to learn from examples. The system was implemented and tested on simulated data and real-world data from seeded tests."

        "description": "Bearing failure is one of the major causes of breakdown in rotating machinery. In complex machines, at the incipient stages of bearing damage, the failure signs are weak compared to other sources of excitations (e.g. gears, shafts, rotors, etc.). The task ofemphasizing the failure signs is complicated by the fact that changes in operating conditions influence vibrations sources and change the frequency and amplitude characteristics of the signal, making it non-stationary. As a result, a joint time-frequencyrepresentation is required. Previous vibration based diagnostic techniques focused on either the time domain or the frequency domain.The proposed method suggests a different solution that applies image processing techniques to spectrograms of the vibration signals in the orders-RPM domain.In the first stage, spectrograms of healthy machines are used to create a baseline. The spectrograms can be obtained using arious time-frequency representations (Wigner-Ville, wavelets, STFT, etc).In the next stage, the distance spectrogram between the inspected recording and the baseline is computed. In the third stage, the distance spectrogram is analyzed using ridge tracking and other image processing algorithms. In the fourth stage, the relations between the detected ridges are compared to the characteristic patterns of the bearing failure modes and the matching ridges are selected. The different stages of analysis: baselines, distance spectrogram, ridges detection andselection, are illustrated with real data of damaged bearings."

        "description": "Acquisition and analysis of signals from mechanical equipment are necessary steps to achieve the goal of fully automatic diagnostics and prognostics. When some of the data is wide-band, such as signals from vibration and acoustic sensors, the processing stage is computationally intensive and requires a sophisticated handling environment. The article presents a proposed architecture for such an environment. This architecture was developed and used successfully in R.K. Diagnostics, and is being offered to its customers. The environment is able to support multiple mechanical systems, different configurations of acquisition equipment, automatic data screening, automatic recognition of operation modes, as well as facilitating flexible flows of algorithms configurable for different combinations of flight regimes, plants, or sensors. Other features of the architecture include providing a simple interface for development of diagnostics and prognostics algorithms, ability to store most of the parameters in external database, and ability to export algorithms to customer embedded platform. The system is OSA/CBM compliant, highly modular, platform independent and flexible. Analysis and illustration of the proposed environment is presented for an application of vibrations data analysis using MATLAB."

        "date": "Jun 2009",
        "description": "Bearing failure is one of the foremost causes of breakdowns in rotating machinery and such failure can be catastrophic, resulting in costly downtime. One of the key issues in bearing prognostics is to detect the defect at its incipient stage and alert the operator before it develops into a catastrophic failure. Vibration analysis can be applied very effectively to rolling element bearing condition monitoring in all three aspects (detection, diagnosis, and prognosis). Signal de-noising and extraction of the weak signature are crucial to bearing prognostics since the signature of a defective bearing is spread across a wide frequency band and, hence, can easily become masked by other sources of excitation and noise. One of the challenges is to enhance the weak signature at the early stage of defect development. The proposed method separates bearing signals from signals of shafts, gears, rotors, pumps, etc. (in fact all the discrete frequencies) since the latter usually dominate the spectrum. The technique is based on a few stages of resampling and removal of the synchronous time average of the vibration signal. The results show the effectiveness of the method for diagnosis and for automatic bearing feature extraction both in terms of orders in the spectrum and orders in the envelope spectrum representation."

        "description": "This paper describes the algorithms that were used for analysis of the PHM‚Äô09 gear-box. The purpose of the analysis was to detect and identify faults in various components of the gear-box. Each of the 560 vibration recordings presented a different set of faults, including distributed and localized gear faults, typical bearing faults and shaft faults. Each fault had to be pinpointed precisely. In the following sections we describe the algorithms used for finding faults in bearings, gears and shafts, and the conclusions that were reached. A special blend of pattern recognition and signal processing methods was applied.Bearings were analyzed using the orders representation of the envelope of a band pass filtered signal and an envelope of the de-phased signal. A special search algorithm was applied for bearings features extraction. The diagnostics of the bearings failure modes was carried out automatically. Gears were analyzed using the order domains, the quefrency of orders, and the derivatives of the phase average."

Rami is a sharp and quick learner who handles complicated tasks with ease and even manages to have fun while doing it. We worked together on a complex chatbot project and I was thoroughly impressed with the advanced and unique contributions Rami made to the project. Our team received a lot of recommendations for this project and it was presented in different forums, which is a testament to the exceptional work that Rami put into it. I would highly recommend Rami to anyone looking for a dedicated, talented and hardworking data scientist. His abilities and positive attitude make him a valuable asset to any team.

        "description": "Final Research project for my BSc degree.Ill-fitting bras are known to cause musculoskeletal pain. However, most women are unable to properly fit a bra for themselves. Additionally, monthly hormonal fluctuations during various stages of the menstrual cycle cause the breast size to fluctuate. Additionally, monthly hormonal fluctuations during various stages of the menstrual cycle cause the breast volume to fluctuate by up to 40%. Therefore, there is a need for a change in the way we design bras, which first requires proper understanding of the relationships between the forces exerted on the breasts, their size, and the resulting stress distribution. Using FEA, we have simulated the stresses and strains on the breast as a function of its size, both under the static influence of gravity, and during gait movement"

Meirav not only coordinated all of us and the speakers through the program, but she was always helping out wether it was SLP-related stuff or our own entrepreneurial issues. I think I speak for all of my class-mates when I say Meirav is one of the greatest leaders and mentors any entrepreneur can find. Her involvement in your venture is worth much more that any physical funding you can think of. Thanks Meirav.‚Äù",

My project was (and probably still is) one of the most challenging and complicated projects in the augmented reality field, and several companies failed to deliver me the desired results. The service,persistence, and end results I got from Ogmentix (led by Ronen) exceeded everything I hoped for. I use this project to this day in big conventions and corporate events all around the globe with huge success. Nimrod Harel‚Äù"

McCormick ‚ÄúUdi and I worked together at Imperva during some of the highest growth years at the company; I have often found that IT and HR can compound each other's effectiveness by working closely together on initiatives. With Udi it was taken to a whole new level and we did this on a basis of tremendous personal trust and respect for professional competency. Udi's impact on the company transcended his job title - Udi's impact was manifested via Human Resources, Recruiting, Site Management, Country GM, and Company Culture on a global basis. Udi has that unique ability to make meaningful impact to the business as the first and only HR person into a company, well through to later stages of growth when he is managing multiple teams, in multiple geographies. If you get the opportunity to work with Udi, don't pass it up.‚Äù"

      "Tal Konstantin Lederman ‚ÄúI Have been working in the same group with Oren (but on another sub-group) for few years. Oren is a team player who has a wide strategic view of processes and projects, yet at the same time is observant and knowledgeable of the smallest details. He is a quick and deep learner and his approach to tasks is professional, responsible and to the point. Always willing to share knowledge and assist beyond formal responsibilities. I enjoyed very much working with Oren as a professional and as a friend.‚Äù"

But this is not the whole story, our day to day work included brain storming, drafts, planning, competitive analysis and fixes.

      "Firas Matar ‚ÄúWhenever you need to make sure you are going in the right direction, and you need to get there in light speed - Dani is your man! Dani have joined our startup, Shield34, as an Execumentor, right after a big crisis. Dani helped us build a turnaround plan, with instant meetings with lots of domain experts from his extensive network, helped us approve it through the BOD and start executing it. Dani knows everybody! Whenever we needed to get a meeting with somebody, like investors, domain experts, executives, etc. Dani arranges those meetings right away. Another important side of Dani, is to put a mirror in your face whenever needed. Lots of times when you are too invested in sprinting forward, you tend to miss the negative sides of your business, or tend to see a rosier picture, he'll be there to stop you to deal with the negatives and get back on track stronger to achieve your goals. Thank you Dani for all the hard work you've put, without your help we wouldn't have got to the highs we managed to achieve!‚Äù",
      "Avihai Michaeli ‚ÄúMost of the founders I've known have a great idea which they wish to promote themselves, but unfortunately not all of them have the managerial skills it takes to \"make it happen\". Those who can are few and unique. Those of them who can make people follow their lead completely are quite rare. After working with Dani for over six years I can say, with no doubt, that he is among the fortunate founders who Mastered not only how to make it happen but has what it take to be called a true leader! Dani is a skillful manager and a worthy professional who is a leader in his soul and actions! You can count on Dani to rise up in times of trouble and distress, and young companies have a lot of those moments... Dani is a solid rock in those times when true leadership is tested I had the privilege to be in Dani's team. The first lesson you can learn from him is that hard and focused work, filled with commitment pays! Or as Mark twain once said \"The dictionary is the only place where success comes before work..\" Keep it up. Proud to be your friend! Avihai Michaeli‚Äù"

I needed someone we could all count on, and Alex delivers above and beyond. He is a creative, out-of-the-box talented thinker on one hand, and a master of execution and detail on the other hand, and above all - a people's person who can get others to do what he envisions, and gain everyone's trust. I hope to do many more things with Alex in the future.‚Äù",

      "Ran Korber ‚ÄúI know Avi for 9 years, and I can say he is truly amazing. Avi is among our first investors supporting BreezoMeter from an Idea to a successful Exit. Over the years, he has been a great mentor for me as CEO of the company and has helped us so much and on so many occasions (in the good times and the challenging times). I'd recommend Avi Eyal and Entr√©e Capital as an investor to any entrepreneur looking for investment. Why? There are numerous reasons. I will highlight a few of them: 1. Entr√©e is a great partner to assist not only during the good times, but also during the challenging times (such as a recession or a Global Pandemic), and every startup will eventually have some challenges. At those critical times, they will be the first to support in any way needed. 2. They help the company while truly putting the founders and the team first. Mentoring 3. Helping with finding and screening C level hirings 4. Helping and supporting complex deals such as strategic partnership and M&As. 5. What is also unique about Entr√©e is their ability to help the company negotiate the best terms for investment while putting the company‚Äôs best interests first; this has also helped Entr√©e to quickly gain the respect of all our other investors. In summary: Avi and the Entr√©e team are truly exceptional and have helped us so much and on so many occasions (in the good times and the challenging times). They have been supportive in and out of the board room, understanding, professional, well connected, responsive, and super positive to every request we had. Emil and I, the BreezoMeter‚Äôs Co-founders recommend Avi Eyal and Entree as an investor to any entrepreneur looking for a friendly, positive, well-connected, and supporting investor and mentor‚Äù",
      "Spyro Karetsos ‚ÄúAvi is an astute service professional with a strong understanding of risk management frameworks and the tools needed for an efficient/effective implementation.‚Äù"

These consist of growth faults accompanied by synthetic and antithetic faults, some of which overlay the Israel Slump Complex (ISC). Displacement patterns allow to distinguish between post- and syn-depositional faults. We present a workflow to investigate the evolution of these faults by analyzing their displacement patterns."

        "subtitle": "ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces",
        "date": "2020",
        "description": "A method to assemble loaded stimuli-responsive DNA-polyacrylamide hydrogel-stabilized microcapsules is presented. The method involves coating substrate-loaded CaCO3 microparticles, functionalized with nucleic acid promoter units, and cross-linking DNA-modified polyacrylamide chains on the microcapsules, using the hybridization chain reaction (HCR) to yield the DNA-cross-linked hydrogel coating. Dissolution of the CaCO3 particles generated the substrate-loaded hydrogel-protected microcapsules. The microcapsule‚Äìhydrogel shells include engineered stimuli-responsive oligonucleotide cross-linkers that control the stiffness of the hydrogel shells, allowing the triggered release of the loads. One approach includes the incorporation of cofactor-dependent DNAzyme units into the cross-linked hydrogel layers (cofactor = Mg2+ ions, Zn2+ ions, or histidine) as stimuli-responsive units. Cleavage of the cross-linking DNAzyme substrates by the respective cofactors yields hydrogel coatings with a reduced stiffness and higher porosity that allow the release of the loads. A further approach involved the application of the HCR process to assemble the bilayer hydrogel microcapsules that are unlocked by two cooperative triggers. Bilayer microcapsules consisting of a K+ ions-stabilized G-quadruplex/18-crown-6-ether (CE) responsive layer and a Mg2+ ion DNAzyme-responsive layers are presented. Unlocking and locking of the G-quadruplex cross-linked layer by 18-crown-6-ether and K+ ions, respectively, in the presence of Mg2+ ions allow the switchable controlled release of the load. In addition, the intercommunication of two kinds of stimuli-responsive bilayer hydrogel microcapsules carrying two different loads (tetramethylrhodamine-dextran, TMR-D, and CdSe/ZnS quantum dots) is demonstrated. The intercommunication process involves the stimuli-triggered generation of ‚Äúinformation transfer‚Äù strands from one microcapsule to another that activate the release of the loads."

        "date": "2020",
        "description": "A method to assemble stimuli-responsive nucleic acid-based hydrogel-stabilized microcapsule-in-microcapsule systems is introduced. pH-responsive microcapsule-in-microcapsule system is loaded with glucose oxidase (GOx) in the inner aqueous compartment and insulin in the outer aqueous compartment. Glucose permeates across the two hydrogel layers resulting in the GOx catalyzed aerobic oxidation of glucose to gluconic acid. The acidification of the microcapsule-in-microcapsule system leads to the triggered unlocking of the outer, pH-responsive hydrogel layer and to the release of insulin. The pH-stimulated release of insulin is controlled by the concentration of glucose. While at normal glucose levels, the release of insulin is practically prohibited, the dose-controlled release of insulin in the entire diabetic range is demonstrated. Also, switchable ON/OFF release of insulin is achieved highlighting an autonomous glucose-responsive microdevice operating as an ‚Äúartificial pancreas‚Äù for the release of insulin."

        "description": "Inspired by nature, where dynamic networks lead to adaptive compositions and emerging functions of the systems, we introduce nucleic-acid‚Äìbased constitutional dynamic assemblies mimicking natural networks. We demonstrate that auxiliary triggers guide the adaptive reconfiguration of the compositions of the constitutional dynamic networks and their emerging functions. Specifically, we introduce the assembly of constitutional dynamic networks revealing negative/positive- and positive/positive-feedback‚Äìdriven operation mechanisms. These processes mimic signal propagation phenomena in biological environments. The feedback-driven mechanisms provide the principles to develop dynamic amplified sensing platforms and to design cascaded logic gate circuits."

        "description": "Intercommunication between dynamic chemical networks plays a major role in cellular transformations. Inspired by nature, we introduce the intercommunication between two constitutional dynamic networks, CDNs, ‚ÄúS‚Äù and ‚ÄúT‚Äù composed, each, of four equilibrated supramolecular constituents AA‚Ä≤, AB‚Ä≤, BA‚Ä≤, and BB‚Ä≤, and of CC‚Ä≤, CD‚Ä≤, DC‚Ä≤, and DD‚Ä≤, respectively. Each of the constituents is conjugated to a Mg2+-ion-dependent DNAzyme unit that acts as a reporter element for the concentration of the respective constituent via the catalyzed cleavage of the fluorophore/quencher-functionalized substrate associated with the respective DNAzyme reporter. Also, constituents BB‚Ä≤ (in CDN ‚ÄúS‚Äù) and CC‚Ä≤ (in CDN ‚ÄúT‚Äù) include Mg2+-ion-dependent DNAzymes acting as activator units for generating triggering signals between the networks. Subjecting CDNs ‚ÄúS‚Äù and ‚ÄúT‚Äù to the catalytically cleavable hairpin trigger Hdd‚Ä≤ or Haa‚Ä≤, respectively, yields input strands that intercommunicate the CDNs by affecting the time-dependent re-equilibration of the constituents of the counter CDN without affecting the dynamic equilibrium of the constituents of the CDN that generates the triggering strands. Treatment of CDNs ‚ÄúS‚Äù and ‚ÄúT‚Äù with hairpins Hdd‚Ä≤ and Haa‚Ä≤ (or Hba‚Ä≤), respectively, stimulates autonomous positive/positive or positive/negative feedback to the programmed time-dependent up-regulation or down-regulation of the equilibrated constituents in the two CDNs."

        "subtitle": "Chemical science",
        "date": "2017",
        "description": "The concentration of molecules can be changed by chemical reactions and thereby offer a continuous readout. Yet computer architecture is cast in textbooks in terms of binary valued, Boolean variables. To enable reactive chemical systems to compute we show how, using the Cox interpretation of probability theory, one can transcribe the equations of chemical kinetics as a sequence of coupled logic gates operating on continuous variables. It is discussed how the distinct chemical identity of a molecule allows us to create a common language for chemical kinetics and Boolean logic. Specifically, the logic AND operation is shown to be equivalent to a bimolecular process. The logic XOR operation represents chemical processes that take place concurrently. The values of the rate constants enter the logic scheme as inputs. By designing a reaction scheme with a feedback we endow the logic gates with a built in memory because their output then depends on the input and also on the present state of the system. Technically such a logic machine is an automaton. We report an experimental realization of three such coupled automata using a DNAzyme multilayer signaling cascade. A simple model verifies analytically that our experimental scheme provides an integrator generating a power series that is third order in time. The model identifies two parameters that govern the kinetics and shows how the initial concentrations of the substrates are the coefficients in the power series."

        "subtitle": "Chemical science",
        "date": "Jan 2017",
        "description": "Herein, a method to construct stimuli-responsive DNA‚Äìacrylamide-based hydrogel microcapsules has been presented. This method involves the use of polyacrylamide chains modified with predesigned nucleic acid hairpin units and optionally single-strand tethers that provide the required hybridization and recognition functions to yield substrate-loaded stimuli-responsive hydrogel-based microcapsules. The synthesis of the microcapsules involves the loading of CaCO3 microparticles with the respective load substrates and the functionalization of the CaCO3 template particles with nucleic acid promoter units. In the presence of the hairpin-modified acrylamide chains, the promoter units induce the hybridization chain reaction (HCR), which leads to the formation of a hydrogel coating, which, after the dissociation of the CaCO3 cores, yields substrate-loaded stimuli-responsive hydrogel microcapsules. One of the microcapsule systems includes, in the hairpin-modified acrylamide constructs, and in the subsequent HCR-generated hydrogel shells, the caged sequences of anti-ATP or anti-cocaine aptamers. In the presence of ATP or cocaine, the duplex-caged aptamer sequences are separated via the formation of ATP- or cocaine‚Äìaptamer complexes, which results in the partial separation of the microcapsules and the release of the loads. The second type of microcapsule is cooperatively stabilized by bridges generated by HCR and pH-sensitive duplex units. Under acidic conditions, the pH-sensitive bridges dissociate via the formation of i-motif structures, which results in an increase in the fluidity of the microcapsule shells and the release of the loads. Preliminary studies indicate that ATP- or pH-responsive microcapsules loaded with the anticancer drug, doxorubicin, have a selective cytotoxic effect on MDA-MB-231 cancer cells"

        "description": "Acrylamide/acrylamide-modified nucleic acid copolymer chains provide building units for the construction of acrylamide‚ÄìDNA hydrogels. Three different hydrogels are prepared by the cross-linking of the acrylamide‚ÄìDNA chains with metal ion-dependent DNAzyme sequences and their substrates. The metal ion-dependent DNAzyme sequences used in the study include the Cu2+-, Mg2+-, and Zn2+-dependent DNAzymes. In the presence of the respective metal ions, the substrates of the respective DNAzymes are cleaved, leading to the separation of the cross-linking units and to the dissolution of the hydrogel. The different hydrogels were loaded with a fluorophore-modified dextran or with a fluorophore-functionalized glucose oxidase. Treatment of the different hydrogels with the respective ions led to the release of the loaded dextran or the enzyme, and the rates of releasing of the loaded macromolecules followed the order of Cu2+ > Mg2+ > Zn2+. Also, the different hydrogels were loaded with the enzymes Œ≤-galactosidase (Œ≤-Gal), glucose oxidase (GOx), or horseradish peroxidase (HRP). In the presence of the appropriate metal ions, the respective hydrogels were dissolved, resulting in the activation of the Œ≤-Gal/GOx or GOx/HRP bienzyme cascades and of the Œ≤-Gal/GOx/HRP trienzyme cascade."

We introduce DNA as a functional material for ternary computing, and in particular demonstrate the use of three-valued oligonucleotide inputs to construct a 3 √ó 3 multiplication table. The system consists of two three-valued inputs of ‚àí1; 0; +1 and a fluorophore/quencher functional hairpin acting as computational and reporter module. The interaction of the computational hairpin module with the different values of the inputs yields a 3 √ó 3 multiplication matrix consisting of nine nanostructures that are read out by three distinct fluorescence intensities. By combining three different hairpin computational modules, each modified with a different fluorophore/quencher pair, and using different sets of inputs, the parallel operation of three multiplication tables is demonstrated."

        "subtitle": "J. Phys. Chem. C",
        "date": "July 26, 2017",
        "description": "An open microcavity (OMC) is an optical system that is composed of two mirrors, where one is fixed and the second is on a movable stage. OMCs enable tuning the optical resonances of the system and insertion of different materials between the mirrors and are therefore of large scientific interest due to their many potential applications. Strong light‚Äìmatter coupling of the vibrational transitions of organic molecules with the optical modes of a microcavity generates new polaritonic states in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectral region. Here we achieve strong light‚Äìmatter coupling in the mid-IR using a low optical-loss OMC that is wavelength-tunable via a piezoelectric actuator. A thin film of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) was deposited onto one of the mirrors to couple the narrow and intense absorption peak of the carbonyl stretch mode at 1731 cm‚Äì1 to the OMC. Polaritonic states are observed in FTIR transmission measurements when an OMC resonance is matched to the carbonyl stretch. By dynamically varying the cavity photon mode around the resonance condition, we determine the normal mode polariton dispersion relation and obtain a maximum Rabi-splitting ‚ÑèŒ©R = 7.0 ¬± 0.18 meV. Different cavity line widths and Rabi-splittings can be achieved by changing the mirror separation, thus providing control of the coupling strength relative to dephasing. The ability to insert multiple materials inside an OMC and generate strong light‚Äìmatter coupling over a large range of wavelengths can open new paths toward chemical reaction modification and energy transfer studies in the mid-IR."

        "subtitle": "MRS Advances",
        "date": "January 30, 2017",
        "description": "Interference lithography has proven to be a useful technique for generating periodic sub-diffraction limited nanostructures. Interference lithography can be implemented by exposing a photoresist polymer to laser light using a two-beam arrangement or a one-beam configuration based on a Lloyd‚Äôs Mirror Interferometer. For typical photoresist layers, an anti-reflection coating must be deposited on the substrate to prevent adverse reflections from cancelling the holographic pattern of the interfering beams. For silicon substrates, such coatings are typically multilayered and complex in composition. By thinning the photoresist layer to a thickness well below the quarter wavelength of the exposing beam, we demonstrate that interference gratings can be generated without an anti-reflection coating on the substrate. We used ammonium dichromate doped polyvinyl alcohol as the positive photoresist because it provides excellent pinhole free layers down to thicknesses of 40 nm, and can be cross-linked by a low-cost single mode 457 nm laser and etched in water. Gratings with a period of 320 nm and depth of 4 nm were realized, as well as a variety of morphologies depending on the photoresist thickness. This simplified interference lithography technique promises to be useful for generating periodic nanostructures with high fidelity and minimal substrate treatments."

        "subtitle": "Bioinformatics and Biomedicine (BIBM), 2013 IEEE International Conference",
        "date": "December 18, 2013",
        "description": "The discovery and functional analysis of noncoding RNA (ncRNA) systems in different organisms motivates the development of tools for aiding ncRNA research. Several tools exist that search for occurrences of a given RNA structural profile in genomic sequences. Yet, there is a need for an ‚ÄùRNA BLAST‚Äù tool, i.e. a tool that takes a putative functional RNA sequence as input, and efficiently searches for similar sequences in genomic databases, taking into consideration potential secondary structure features of the input query sequence. This work aims at providing such a tool. Our tool, denoted StemSearch, is based on a structural representation of an RNA sequence by its potential stems. Potential stems in genomic sequences are identified in a preprocessing stage, and indexed. A user provided query sequence is likewise processed, and stems from the target genomes which are similar to the query stems are retrieved from the index. Then, relevant genomic regions are identified and ranked according to their similarity to the query stem-set while enforcing conservation of cross-stem topology. Experiments using RFAM families show significantly improved recall for StemSearch over BLAST, with small loss of precision. We further demonstrate our system's capability to handle eukaryotic genomes by successfully searching for members of the 7SK family in chromosome 2 of the human genome."

        "description": "In this demo we shall present the IBM Patient Empowerment System (PES), and more specifically, its social-medical discovery sub-system. Social and medical data are represented using entities and relationships and are explored using a combination of expressive, yet intuitive, query language, faceted search, and ER graph navigation. While this demonstration focuses on the healthcare domain, the underlining search technology is generic and can be utilized in many other domains. Therefore, this demo has two main contributions. First, we present a novel entity-relationship indexing and retrieval solution, and discuss its implementation challenges. Second, the demonstration depicts a practical entity-relationship discovery technology in a real domain setting within a real IBM system."

While Shay is a hardworking person and highly devoted to his work, he is always pleasant, optimistic and never passes on an opportunity to help those around him. With his keen mind, sharp insights and can-do mindset, he helped me and others tremendously, even though our research was beyond the scope of Shay's \"bread and butter\".

        "description": "In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for BGP hijacking detection that is based on the observation that during a hijack attack, the functional roles of ASNs along the route change. To identify a functional change, we build on previous work that embeds ASNs to vectors based on BGP routing announcements and embed each IP address prefix (AP) to a vector representing its latent characteristics, we call it AP2Vec. Then, we compare the embedding of a new route with the AP embedding that is based on the old routes to identify large differences."

We employ a model that uses the inter-arrival times to parameterize the derivative of the flow hidden-state using a neural network (Neural ODE). We compare our results with a solution that uses the same data without the ODE solver and show the benefit of this approach."

        "date": "October 1, 2021",
        "description": "IP hijack attacks deflect traffic between endpoints through the attacker network, leading to man-in-the-middle attacks. Current detection solutions are only based on AS-level path analysis, while attacks that include data-plane manipulations may exhibit only geographic anomalies and preserve the AS-level route, or hide the problematic AS in the path. Thus, there is a need to develop data-plane analysis frameworks that examine the actual route packets traverse. We introduce here a deep learning system that examines the geography of traceroute measurements to detect malicious routes. We use multiple geolocation services, with various levels of confidence; each also suffers from location errors. Moreover, identifying a hijacked route is not sufficient since an operator presented with a hijack alert needs an indication of the cause for flagging out the problematic route. Thus, we introduce a novel deep learning layer, called Source-Aware Self-Attention (SASA), which is an extension of the attention mechanism. SASA learns each data source's confidence and combines this score with the attention of each router in the route to point out the most problematic one. We validate our IP hijacking classification method using two router data types: coordinates and country location, and show that SASA outperforms the regular self-attention layer, using the same neural network architecture, and achieves extremely high accuracy."

        "description": "Identifying the type of a network flow or a specific application has many advantages, such as, traffic engineering, or to detect and prevent application or application types that violate the organization‚Äôs security policy. The use of encryption, such as VPN, makes such identification challenging. Current solutions rely mostly on handcrafted features and then apply supervised learning techniques for the classification. We introduce a novel approach for encrypted Internet traffic classification and application identification by transforming basic flow data into an intuitive picture, a FlowPic, and then using known image classification deep learning techniques, CNNs, to identify the flow category (browsing, chat, video, etc.) and the application in use. We show that our approach can classify traffic with high accuracy, both for a specific application, or a flow category, even for VPN and Tor traffic. Our classifier can even identify with high success new applications that were not part of the training phase for a category, thus, new versions or applications can be categorized without additional training."

Similar to natural language processing (NLP) models, we show that by using BGP route announcements as sentences, we can embed each AS number (ASN) to a vector that represents its latent characteristics. In order to solve this supervised learning problem, we use these vectors as an input to a recurrent neural network and achieve an excellent result: an accuracy of 99.99% for BGP hijack detection with 0.00% false alarm. We test our method on 48 past hijack events between the years 2008 and 2018 and detect 32 of them, and in particular, all the events within two years from our training data."

In this problem, we attempt to reveal the economic relationships between ASes, data with applications in network routing management and routing security.In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for ToR classification, which is based on embedding the AS numbers (ASN) in high dimensional space using neural networks. Similar to natural language processing (NLP) models, the embedding represents latent characteristics of the ASN and its interactions on the Internet. The embedding coordinates of each AS are represented by a vector; thus, we call our method BGP2VEC. In order to solve the supervised learning problem presented, we use these vectors as an input to an artificial neural network and achieve a state of the art accuracy of 95.2% for ToR classification."

We classified with high success VPN traffic when the training was done for a non-VPN traffic. Our categorization can identify with good success new applications that were not part of the training phase. We can also use the same CNN to classify applications with an accuracy of 99.7%. Overall, our approach achieves significant better performance than previous work, and can handle classification problems that were not studied in the past."

In this second part of the series, we will discuss the transition to FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) data management principles as an inevitable step, as the data fingerprints of the advanced products of today are no longer possible to capture in documents only.The communication of data between the life sciences industry and the authorities remains document-centric (by law), which means it is riddled with narratives, slow, and prone to bias and misinterpretation. It is imperative for both the regulators and the industry to expedite the drug approval process, especially for orphan drugs and unmet clinical needs. To do so, we must become more efficient with our data and reap its full benefits. Contrary to prior technological innovations, this time it is the regulators that are showing us the way and it is prudent that we follow their lead.We will discuss recent initiatives from the FDA, such as KASA, PQ/CMC, and the ICH SPQS and see how they could be the early birds of the paradigm shift from electronic CTDs to digital CTDs. We will address what steps the industry should be taking in parallel with the authorities in preparation for this (very near) digital future."

      "Elad Goldman ‚ÄúIn my role as the CONNECT program manger for ADAMA's ERP implementation program, I have had the pleasure of working closely with Daniela Rudy. In the context of SAP programs, I relied heavily on Daniela to provide expert PMO skills to ensure our portfolio always stayed on track, which in fact it did. Daniela's in-depth project and methodologies knowledge, including Agile and modern project management tools, has been a foundation for our management strategy, ensuring we are capturing all requirements while providing the highest internal and external service possible. Daniela's ability to multi-task is impressive to say the least, as her responsibilities were enormous. She also managed to participate successfully and extensively in other activities not always directly related to her specific project responsibilities. My experience in working with Daniela has been extremely positive. Her participation and skills were very valuable to ADAMA's ERP program.‚Äù",
      "Guillermo Dulanto Vergara ‚ÄúDaniela is a very committed person, fast learner and very well structured in her work, which makes her a very valuable resource for any project regardless the nature of the solution being applied. Her experience in PMO has helped a lot to develop a good relationship with the client, who had full confidence on her as good advisor and supportive person, taking care of a lot of important topics that were completed with a very good tracking, timely reporting and response from her side, attending usually to the Steering Committee meetings with the top management. In addition to that Daniela was able to deal with a multicultural team guiding it through the PMO insights, requirements for reporting and status of the different activities, coordinating them properly and taking as well the ownership of all the billing process E2E, making her a reference for any topic related to the financials. In general terms Daniela performed perfectly and I'd recommend her to any project in which there is a need of establishing a strong PMO layer. ‚Äù"

      "Yoni Leitersdorf ‚ÄúElad has been amazing to work with. Someone once asked me what is Elad's comfort zone. That's the first time I realized he doesn't have a \"comfort zone\". He's a \"get-the-job-done\" kind of guy, comfortable in any situation. Ideal for tough and complex challenges, small teams and situations that require a ton of creativity. It's not a result of chance that Elad's experience is in the startup world. If you are looking for someone who can define a product from scratch, build business partnerships that seem far fetched or articulate your message clearly, Elad would be my recommendation. He'll be a driving force in your attempt to take over the world.‚Äù",
      "Glen Pirrotta ‚ÄúElad is a very strong technical and executive leader. He directly assisted me and my organization on highly complex and innovative tooling surveillance that enabled us to identify defects before we experienced outages or service impairments. His work and ability to engage my staff in the right areas led us to not only succeed in the deployment of new solutions, it also enabled us to push for new features to meet our emerging use cases and needs.‚Äù"

        "subtitle": "Transportation Research Board",
        "date": "January 13, 2019",
        "description": "Signalized-intersections have a great impact on the efficiency and safety of the entire roadnetwork. At the end of the green phase, the driver is required to assess the distance between hisvehicle and the stop line, and decide whether the duration of the yellow phase will allow him tocross the intersection safely, before the light turns red or whether he will not be able to make itand therefore he should come to a full stop in front of the stop line. Wrong decisions of bothtypes increase the risk of accidents.This study examines how drivers` behavior in a driving simulator is affected when an in-vehiclerecommendation-system (IVRS) is installed in their vehicle. The IVRS connects with the trafficlight and serves as a tool for the drivers in deciding whether to cross or stop at the intersection.The IVRS records the speed of the vehicle, its distance from the traffic light, and the remainingtime for the green and yellow phases. The application provides an alert if it estimates that thedriver will cross the intersection in the red phase.The results of the study indicate that the existence of an IVRS, compared to driving without anIVRS, significantly reduces the number of vehicles crossing in red light by 8%, and significantlyimproves drivers` decision-making process during crossing the intersections by 12%."

      "Yonatan Perry ‚ÄúI have worked with Tal for almost four years, and it was an excellent experience throughout. A part of the founding technical team, his super strong design and implementation capabilities were prominent from day one, and were only matched by his interpersonal abilities. It takes a rare combination to rip you to shreds during code review, and make you come out smiling and enjoying the experience! This became even more dominant as Tal made the switch to team management. Managing him as a manager himself, I trusted him to get the job done, no matter the challenges and all while keeping his focus on building a team with a positive attitude. This is a guy I'm sure I'll work with in the future, one way or another.‚Äù",
      "Adi Belan ‚ÄúTal is one of the most intelligent and creative persons i have ever met or worked with. His dedication and great skills would be an asset to every company. He has a great team player, and was always a pleasure to work with.‚Äù"

        "description": "LAW-TRAIN is an European Commission funded project aimed at fighting international drug-trafficking by developing a virtual interrogation training system. The training system is developed in a collaborative action by universities, national governments and professional enterprises.The virtual gaming platform will allow law enforcement units to practice the interrogation of suspects in a multicultural and virtual reality context. Through extensive research in the field of computer science and criminology the mixed reality gaming platform makes it possible to generate characters with changing attributes and parameters. Based on these demographic variables, so called ‚ÄúVirtual Suspects‚Äù can be generated, which will give rise to multiple interrogation scenarios in a close to realistic environment. Because of the virtual nature of the system, the simulator will be accessible from any country at any given time. To improve the training results, so called ‚ÄúIntervention Agents‚Äù will follow the practice sessions online and give real-time feedback to trainees."

        "date": "August 22, 2016",
        "description": "At Jolt, we got rid of the beer taps, pool tables, game consoles, mechanical bulls, yoga training, power napping, whipped cream munching ‚Äì basically, all the stuff tech giants use to distract employees from the fact that they‚Äôre stuck in a a job that won‚Äôt help them grow into the people they want to be, won‚Äôt enable them to leave a real mark and definitely won‚Äôt help them figure out how to achieve their career goals. In fact, current workplaces optimize for EMPLOYEE RETENTION, which means their main focus is keeping people in place instead of pushing them forward. This concise eBook will help you dodge Silicon Valley's clich√©, by rethinking the entire employment deal with Chapterships. In this book, Roei, the millennial CEO of Jolt, portrays a unique vision to the future of work - that it a must-read to any professional who feels like the current system is broken."

      "Ohad Ozer ‚ÄúI've worked alongside Michael for about 4 years at Cellebrite and team-worked with him in varies projects. Michael is a hard working, mission dedicated engineer. During most of 2019 he was a lead designer and main pusher for one of the most important and valuable company wide next generation projects, planing & building the foundations piece-by-piece. Michael brings to the table good C/C++ low level knowledge combined with fluent Python-2.x/3.x skills. I would always be happy to recommend Michael to any development team.‚Äù",
      "Dani Mannes ‚ÄúMichael's outstanding skills and capability to learn and adopt new technologies makes him the ultimate partner for complex SW development tasks. I coached Michael in adopting model driven SW architecture design and development using UML and Rhapsody. He was new to this type of development, but in now time was capable of working on his own and deigned incredibly flexible and change resistant models and implementations. It was a great great working with him, he was true asset for the project.‚Äù"

      "Ofer Shezaf ‚ÄúApplication Security Research is an extremely challenging work. One naturally has to be an information security expert and a master programmer. But on top of that one has to be very independent and resourceful as research projects tend to take you into unexpected journeys into uncharted territories. As a result I always found it hard to recruit researchers. While I did find some good ones, Avi was the only one that did not just fulfill all the requirements but was actually overqualified. Most of us can do our job because it is not rocket science. But if your business *is* rocket science, you need Avi.‚Äù"

Not only does he have the ability to divide complex algorithmic projects into easily accomplishable tasks, he is also apt at managing the implementation stages of such projects, either by himself or by coordinating group efforts. Igor has a sharp mind, thorough work habits and good organizational skills. He is also highly motivated and will surely be an asset to any employer.‚Äù",
      "Slava Kisilevich ‚ÄúI was working with Igor on the same DT project for near 2 years. Igor is a very committed person. Once he starts something he tries to finish it in a best, efficient and fastest way. Igor is also a very easy going person which is a very good trait for team environment. Besides Igor's technical skills, it is worth to mention that he is a creative and sportive person which can teach you how to play table tennis, darts, basketball or good healthy tuna-weedy-rice-salat in your spare time. I would highly recommend him for a kind of job which requires analytical and administrative skills.‚Äù"

As her colleague, while heading the nonclinical writing team and later as her direct manager, I noticed Leehee‚Äôs eye for details, collaborative spirit and critical thinking. Leehee consistently gave 100% of herself and above. Leehee, who has vast medical writing experience in several therapeutic areas in all drug developmental stages, was a very valuable member of the medical writing department and contributed well beyond her core responsibilities, sharing her knowledge and supporting junior writers and internal stakeholders, who highly respected her and were impressed by her high level of personal and professional skills. Leehee‚Äôs biggest strength is her ability to write complex medical writing documents and deal with conflicting priorities in high-pressure situations. Leehee will be an asset to any company that she will work for.‚Äù"

      "Tomer Nosrati ‚ÄúI have experienced Alon's work as my CTO at Mayple and had worked tightly with his codebase for about 1.5-2 years. Alon has what I like to call, the \"Beast Mode\", where you see him sits at his desk during the day like any normal workday but a few days later he \"updates\" that he just did this and that which sometimes are very complicated and valuable improvements to our whole eco-system. Some honorable mentions are: - A Python 3 module to interact with the Swydo API: https://github.com/mayple/swydo - Lead handling system for allowing more efficient lead capturing. - Tasks system design that provides a simple solution to a complicated business requirement. - Complete pay system with modular support for changing business requirements (as are often in a startup). All in all, these systems are implemented in the S.O.L.I.D design principles which have provided a direct ROI with me personally by simplifying my work and reducing the time it took me to finish my tasks that were involved with Alon's work. In addition, a bonus feature to his implementation is a self-explaining-feature as in, to learn his code I didn't need anything more than the feature's specifications and the code itself. Seeing how beautifully Alon's code components integrate and \"play\" with each other to create a modular feature flow is inspiring work and an example to any novice to pro (included) software engineer.‚Äù",
      "Alexey Tochilkin ‚ÄúWhen I worked in Selectom it was a small startup, so, as it usually happens to startups, Alon was on multiple positions at the same time: system architect, full stack software developer, team lead, devops, CTO. And I can say that he handled every role perfectly or close to that. He has extremely strong technical background, knows huge stack of different technologies and because of that he can take every technical role in a software development team. As for his management skills I can tell from the point of view of Alon's team member - our team did an incredible amount of work in a short period of time. I appreciated his ability to organise work in such an efficient way. So I highly recommend to hire Alon, 100% he will be useful and there will be a lot of things, which he can develop and improve ‚Äù"

      "Bari Farhi ‚ÄúI had the pleasure of working closely with Idan for several years while building our start-up in the Algo-trading industry. As our 1st employee, he managed to build and architect our entire platform from scratch, while showing impressive control over various technologies and domains. Idan basically acted as a \"1 Stop Shop\" for all our needs as a start-up in the aspects of software engineering, technology selection integration, big-data, tracing, networking and DevOPS, while constantly supervising & contributing to our technological progress, tackling the most complex problem in latency sensitive, high-load, ever evolving platform. He's a very responsible self-driven employee with a huge curiosity and enthusiasm for problem solving ‚Äì has a big part in our success as a company.‚Äù",
      "David Rachamim ‚ÄúIdan joined my team during the development of Heed, with the goal of advancing our video handling capabilities. Idan was very quick to learn the product, the architecture and the requirements. He designed and developed a complex video transfer solution, which became a core component in the product. Idan proved to be an excellent software professional. His initiative and leadership, his vast knowledge and experience, his understanding of hardware, and his ability to design and implement a high-quality solution within the constraints of a complex project were critical for the success of the product. I'm sure that Idan will be able to push forward any product, as he's done with Heed and I'm privileged to continue to work with him.‚Äù"

During that time, I was consistently impressed by her technical skills, work ethic, and professionalism. Yael is an excellent problem solver and has a deep understanding of software engineering principles. She is able to quickly identify issues and develop effective solutions. She is also a great team player and works well with others to achieve project goals. During her time working with me, Yael was responsible for developing and maintaining several key software systems. She consistently delivered high-quality work on time. She was also able to effectively communicate technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders, which was critical in ensuring that project goals were met. Overall, I highly recommend Yael for any software engineering position. She would be a valuable asset to any organization.‚Äù",

        "description": "Several recent projects have introduced digital machines to the kitchen, yet their impact on culinary culture is limited. We envision a culture of Digital Gastronomy that enhances traditional cooking with new interactive capabilities, rather than replacing the chef with an autonomous machine. Thus, we deploy existing digital fabrication instruments in traditional kitchen and integrate them into cooking via hybrid recipes. This concept merges manual and digital procedures, and imports parametric design tools into cooking, allowing the chef to personalize the tastes, flavors, structures and aesthetics of dishes. In this paper we present our hybrid kitchen and the new cooking methodology, illustrated by detailed recipes with degrees of freedom that can be set digitally prior to cooking. Lastly, we discuss future work and conclude with thoughts on the future of hybrid gastronomy."

      "Hanni Barry ‚ÄúI had the pleasure of working with Shlomi for two years at Varonis, at the same department. Shlomi‚Äôs passion for solutions that truly answer the customer‚Äôs need combined with his focus on details provided customers the solutions they craved. His remarkable interpersonal skills, always working with a smile and striving to have all parties aboard contributed to the success of his projects and the working atmosphere. Shlomi would be an asset to any company bent on customer satisfaction.‚Äù",
      "Assi Abramovitz ‚ÄúShlomi joined Sigmadots as the product leader. At a startup like Sigmadots, defining the product's goals, features, and target customers is critical and Shlomi realized it very clearly and acted accordingly. He immediately took the initiative to create a broad array of potential features and present them to the team to select our next steps from. He insisted on finding our product-market-fit and defining the MVP accordingly, while already envisioning the next phases. In defining the product, he always had the value to customer in mind but also the potential sales pitch and the tools that it would require. In addition to acting as a product manager, he was also the best sales person on board, and was the best guy to speak to customers. His ability to connect to people is clear from the first meeting and it is that skill that makes him a great sales person, a great teammate and a great project coordinator. Shlomi brings a lot of positive energy wherever he goes, even in light of challenges. I have worked with many product managers in my career, and I see Shlomi as one of the best. I will be very happy to work with Shlomi in the future. Assi‚Äù"

        "subtitle": "BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine",
        "date": "May 22, 2020",
        "description": "In individual sports, the effect that injuries have on an athlete‚Äôs performance, success, and financial profit is implicit. In contrast, the effect of a single player‚Äôs injury or one player‚Äôs absence in team sports is much more difficult to quantify, both from the performance perspective and the financial perspective.In this study, we attempted to estimate the effect of injuries on the performance of football teams from the English Premier League (EPL), and the financial implications derived from this effect.Our analysis is based on data regarding game results, injuries and estimations of the players‚Äô financial value for the 2012‚Äì2013 through the 2016‚Äì2017 seasons.We found a statistically significant relationship (r=‚àí0.46, 95% CI ‚àí0.6 to 0.28, p=0.001) between the number of days out due to injuries suffered by team members during a season and the place difference between their actual and expected finish in the EPL table (according to overall player value). Moreover, we can interpolate that approximately 136 days out due to injury causes a team the loss of one league point, and that approximately 271 days out due to injury costs a team one place in the table. This interpolation formula is used as a heuristic model, and given the relationship specified above accounts for a significant portion of the variance in league placement (21%), the remaining variance is related to other factors. Calculating the costs of wage bills and prize money, we estimate that an EPL team loses an average of ¬£45‚Äâmillion sterling due to injury-related decrement in performance per season.Professional football clubs have a strong economic incentive to invest in injury prevention and rehabilitation programs."

        "date": "February 19, 2020",
        "description": "The purpose of the current study was to determine the differences between top and average football playing. To do so we analysed 1,240 matches from the top Israeli and Italian leagues; each match included information on 455 game parameters. A two-phase analysis was performed. In Phase 1 of the analysis we found that the ball movement (e.g., higher number of passes into the box, higher number of key passes), as well as the attack efficiency (higher absolute and relative number of shots from the box, higher number of attacks that entered the box), are significantly superior in the Italian football league. In Phase 2, we identified which game parameters are most important for winning in both leagues. Our results revealed that the success of the matches in both leagues is determined by similar parameters, such as key passes, shots on target, actions up the pitch, and pass precision."

Officially his position was VP R&D, but in reality Yuval performed outstandingly and with great skill and perseverance in every aspect of the company's operation including sales, business development, and of course all aspects of research and development. During the course of his work at ConicIT (2.5 years), Yuval created standards and methods that allowed us as a small company to complete many more tasks than the norm in the software world. Personally, Yuval's work helped me immensely and he was the acting CEO of the company during all times that I was away (some of these were extended periods of time). The company's products carry a seal of quality in great part due to him.‚Äù",

Adam always responded quickly to IT support tickets and went above and beyond to help when needed, and was proactive in ensuring issues were not only resolved, but also prevented.

She is confident, assertive, representative, and funny at the same time :) She knows how to attract candidates and create solid pipelines since she has great sourcing and head-hunting skills. She knows how to push and promote people/projects/processes. I think that she has high emotional intelligence and great consulting skills. In addition, her English is amazing and she has good marketing and branding taste. I really enjoyed working with her and I'm thankful for the great times we had.‚Äù"

      "Arbel Deutsch Peled ‚ÄúIt was my honor to witness Yael's work as her manager while she was leading Twiggle's largest Knowledge Engineering team. Yael grew into her positions with both rapidity and grace, quickly becoming one of the most well-respected personas in the Knowledge Engineering group, and indeed in the company as a whole. Yael has shown great acumen in both technical and human matters, way beyond her years. She was a great source of knowledge to her team (and to the group), and was often consulted for her deep understanding of the subject material. Perhaps more importantly, she was a true leader for her team, which she built with her own two hands to the point where they could be trusted to efficiently perform any task given them, and to deliver quality results on time. Yael possesses the rare combination of truly and deeply caring for her team members as individuals, as well as clearly seeing both their strengths and weaknesses, and how they can contribute to the team effort. She was a constant source of peace of mind to myself, as I always knew that if Yael is in charge of something I can trust her to outperform, and to ask for advice if she needs it. She will definitely make a great leader some day.‚Äù"

      "Nofar Plotnik ‚ÄúArieh was a supportive and motivational colleague, in the Data Team at Snap Inc. When I joined the team, Arieh was responsible for my integration into the team and Company. Starting out, Arieh was very welcoming and patient, he taught me the setup and role within a short amount of time. Once I had completed my onboarding, Arieh and I worked on multiple projects together. I saw just how eager and cable Arieh is in understanding new and complex concepts. He is a strong listener and was able to think outside of the box, coming up with practical ideas that helped us meet deadlines. Arieh is approachable and always prepared to provide support. Overall, I had a great time working alongside Arieh and hope to work with more people like him in the future.‚Äù",
      "Elior Cohen ‚ÄúI was fortunate to have Arieh as a member of my team at Snap Inc, where he served as a Data Engineer. He consistently demonstrated a strong work ethic, a deep understanding of his field, and a commitment to excellence. He always met deadlines and exceeded expectations on any task he took on, even when it was new and unfamiliar to him. I was always impressed by Arieh‚Äôs willingness to take on extra work, while already juggling his own projects, and his determination to continuously grow and learn new skills. Arieh is a great team player, consistently eager to support and encourage others. For example, he proposed and implemented an automation system that helped his colleagues manage their projects more effectively, resulting in improved quality and overall team performance. I strongly recommend hiring Arieh and I am confident he will be an asset to any team he joins.‚Äù"

During the time I worked with Eyal, I found him to be a caring, emphatic manager who cares deeply about his employees both in a personal and professional level. you can always count on Eyal to guide you with a good advice & provide you with constructive feedback. On top of that, with great deal of care & hard work, Eyal navigated Wix Haifa office from a conception at a small shared space to a fully fledged building that accommodates 20 employees and counting! I would highly recommend Eyal, and looking forward for an opportunity to work with him again. ‚Äù",

I had the pleasure of working with him at Wix, where both of us led teams under the same group, and working with Eyal was a fantastic experience for me. He was an inspiration to the group as he always went the extra mile and found great ways to quickly solve problems. Eyal definitely leads by example, he‚Äôs an exceptional mentor, always keeps the team motivated, and always looks for new challenges to deal with. I really wish I‚Äôll have the opportunity to work with him in the future.‚Äù"

        "description": "We combine visual programming using Google Blockly with a single-threaded implementation of behavioral programming (BP) in JavaScript, and propose design patterns for developing reactive systems such as client-side Web applications and smartphone customization applications as collections of independent cross-cutting scenarios that are interwoven at run time. We show that BP principles can be instrumental in addressing common software engineering issues such as separation of graphical representation from logic and the handling of inter-object scenarios. We also show that a BP infrastructure can be implemented with limited run-time resources in a single-threaded environment using coroutines. In addition to expanding the availability of BP capabilities, we hope that this work will contribute to the evolving directions of technologies and design patterns in developing interactive applications. We present an approach for Behavioral Programming (BP) in JavaScript (JS) and Blockly.The approach allows for intuitive incremental development of reactive applications.We propose design patterns for interfacing with external environments from BP in JS.We demonstrate BP programs in Blockly and in JS for interactive client side applications.We introduce a small tool for smartphone customization based on interwoven scenarios."

Our approach is to combine visual programming using Google Blockly with a single-threaded implementation of behavioral programming in JavaScript. We show how the behavioral programming principles can be implemented with minimal programming resources, i.e., with a single-threaded environment using coroutines. We give initial, yet full, examples of how behavioral programming is instrumental in addressing common issues in this application domain, e.g., that it facilitates separation of graphical representation from logic and handling of complex inter-object scenarios. The implementation in JavaScript and Blockly (separately and together) expands the availability of behavioral programming capabilities, previously implemented in LSC, Java, Erlang and C++, to audiences with different skill-sets and design approaches."

We propose that behavioral programming concepts, such as behavioral decomposition, synchronized execution of independent behaviors, and event blocking, can help in the incremental and natural coding of complex decentralized systems, complementing actor-oriented and agent-oriented approaches. We also contribute to the existing research on behavioral programming a method for coordinating behaviorally-programmed components which, due to different time scales or interaction with the external environment, cannot synchronize and thus cannot employ event blocking. We show that the resulting decentralized system retains many of the advantages present in a purely behavioral, fully synchronized system."

        "description": "In this work we present OPM/PL, a suite of modeling tools based on the Object-Process Methodology (OPM) and implemented in Prolog. OPM/PL includes tools for model authoring, querying and visualization, as well as code parsing and code generation. OPM/PL aims at integrating the information from the source code, models and requirements of a software project into a single database with a uniform format. This approach extends the role of a modeling tool to include a representation of the code and its relations to the model. The OPM/PL database contains both model elements and information from code parsing. This combined representation allows developers to flesh out a model from existing code, and update the code according changes in the model. Thus, OPM/PL provides a system for round-trip modeling."

        "date": "Jan 2010",
        "description": "ehavioral programming, introduced by the LSC language and extended by the BPJ Java library, enables development of behaviors as independent modules that are relatively oblivious of each other, yet are integrated at run-time yielding cohesive system behavior. In this paper we present a proof-of-concept for infrastructure and a design pattern that enable development of such behavioral programs in Erlang. Each behavior scenario, called a behavior thread, or b-thread, runs in its own Erlang process. Runs of programs are sequences of events that result from three kinds of b-thread actions: requesting that events be considered for triggering, waiting for triggered events, and blocking events that may be requested by other b-threads. A central mechanism handles these requests, and coordinates b-thread execution, yielding composite, integrated system behavior. We also introduce a visualization tool for Erlang programs written in the proposed design pattern. We believe that enabling the modular incremental development of behavioral programming in Erlang could further simplify the development and maintenance of applications consisting of concurrent independent behaviors."

        "subtitle": "International Conference on Evaluation of Novel Approaches to Software (ENASE)",
        "date": "Jan 2010",
        "description": "Generating code for associations is one of the most fundamental requirements from a model-based code generator. There are several approaches for implementing associations, ranging from using basic collections frameworks to using a database. The choice between them derive from the current requirements of the software: Whether parallelism, caching or persistency required for a relation. Hard-coding a specific design choice makes it difficult to alter it later. In this work, we propose a scheme that allows for automatic code generations of associations with different features, without requiring manual changes to the code. These features include using indices, traversing the association in parallel, or using an external database. Instead of the sequential iterator interface, we propose to use an interface that is based on operations over collections, such as Foreach, Filter, Map and Fold. This interface allows for writing operations that traverse the association without being dependent on the implementation details of the generated code."

        "description": "As touch sensitive screens become more ubiquitous, impediments to their use have more debilitating implications. An example of such an impediment is muscular tremor, such as experienced by people with Parkinson's disease, CP, or MS. Muscle tremors can affect users'‚Äã ability to accurately manipulate icons, leading to frustration and lost productivity.This project seeks to build a prototype User Interface (UI) for use with touch-sensitive screens, which will accept tremor-affected input, and use it to deduce the user's intended input, using machine learning and signal processing techniques to neutralize the effect of the tremor on the usage patterns."

        "description": "Model-based diagnosis (MBD) is a fundamental approach for automated diagnosis, in which a model of the diagnosed system is used to identify abnormally behaving system components. As systems become large-scale and more complex, their models also grow in size, and consequently applying MBD becomes more computationally challenging. Structural abstraction was shown to be effective in scaling up MBD algorithms to larger systems. However, past work on using structural abstraction in MBD assumed, either explicitly or implicitly, a weak fault model (WFM), i.e., that the system model specify only the normal behavior of the system components. Therefore, the resulting diagnoses can be inconsistent with existing knowledge about how the system behaves when it is abnormal. System models that contain such information are said to have a strong fault model (SFM). In this work, we show that a standard approach for using cones abstraction, a form of structural abstraction that was shown to be useful for directional systems, does not work for systems with a SFM. Then, we propose several sound and complete algorithms that can use a cones abstraction effectively to diagnose systems with a SFM. Some of these algorithms use Machine Learning techniques to predict which cones will not be useful in the diagnosis process and should be discarded. Empirical evaluation on benchmark systems that model Boolean circuits shows that our algorithms are very effective in practice. The empirical evaluation also sheds light on how various system properties affect the comparative performance of the proposed algorithm."

        "description": "In the not-so-far future, autonomous vehicles will be ubiquitous and, consequently, need to be coordinated to avoid traffic jams and car accidents. A failure in one or more autonomous vehicles may break this coordination, resulting in reduced efficiency (due to traffic load) or even bodily harm (due to accidents). The challenge we address in this paper is to identify the root cause of such failures. Identifying the faulty vehicles in such cases is crucial in order to know which vehicles to repair to avoid future failures as well as for determining accountability (e.g., for legal purposes). More generally, this paper discusses multi-agent systems (MAS) in which the agents use a shared pool of resources and they coordinate to avoid resource contention by agreeing on a temporal resource allocation. The problem we address, called the Temporal Multi-Agent Resource Allocation (TMARA) diagnosis problem (TMARA-Diag), is to find the root cause of failures in such MAS that are caused by malfunctioning agents that use resources not allocated to them. As in the autonomous vehicles example, such failures may cause the MAS to perform suboptimally or even fail, potentially causing a chain reaction of failures, and we aim to identify the root cause of such failures, i.e., which agents did not follow the planned resource allocation. We show how to formalize TMARA-Diag as a model-based diagnosis problem and how to compile it to a set of logical constraints that can be compiled to Boolean satisfiability (SAT) and solved efficiently with modern SAT solvers. Importantly, the proposed solution does not require the agents to share their actual plans, only the agreed upon temporal resource allocation and the resources used at the time of failure. Such solutions are key in the development and success of intelligent, large, and security-aware MAS."

        "description": "This paper's subject is model-based diagnosis in strong fault model (SFM).Diagnosis is concerned with the development of algorithms and techniques that are able to determine whether the behavior of a system is correct. If the system is not functioning correctly, the algorithm should be able to determine which components are failing.Model-based diagnosis uses a model of the system to diagnose the problem. Past work of Dr. Meir Kalech and Dr. Roni Stern, either explicitly or implicitly, assume a weak fault-model (WFM), where only the proper behavior of the system is specified.Diagnosing a system with strong fault-model (SFM), which is a system model that includes some information about how faulty component behave, is a harder problem. We proposed some approaches to address this problem, but there is not universal winner between them, so a further research is needed. The approaches were implemented in Prolog. We used an external SAT Solver to diagnose the systems in order to get a better runtime."

      "Sagie Grunhaus ‚ÄúI worked side by side with Tal for 5 years while growing XRHealth's product organization. Tal has an amazing set of unique capabilities all wrapped up in one person. He is bot a Macro and Micro person, which is rare. He has an amazing ability to deeply understand the product and business strategy, in which direction to navigate and where we want the product/company to be in the future. This comes in parallels to a very strong detail oriented understanding of every aspect of the product and what is needed for something to succeed. Tal is a technical product guy, the kind that people come to from all around the organization to understand how something should be built or why this/that is happening. Tal is very data oriented, he built the XRHealth Data organization, infrastructure and dashboards from zero. Connected with his strong product and business understanding this makes him a valuable asset for analyzing performance and defining where the company needs to go on any level. All of this comes with a very humble attitude, a \"no bu****it\" mentality and \"roll up his sleeves and lets get to work\" managing style. I hope Tal and my paths will cross again in the future, I would definitely love to work together again.‚Äù",
      "Shai Gabay-Angel ‚ÄúI've been working with Tal for almost 2 years, while he was leading the Data department at VRHealth. Tal is an extraordinary manager and a true professional in his fields. Tal has the amazing ability to explain complex ideas in a simple way, he's an excellent team leader and has great execution capabilities. Tal has a deep understanding of the business, knows which questions to ask and how to deliver the data to the stakeholders in a meaningful way. It was a great pleasure to work with him and I hope that our ways will cross again in the future!‚Äù"

        "description": "Detecting computer worms is a highly challenging task. We present a new approach that uses artificial neural networks (ANN) to detect the presence of computer worms based on measurements of computer behavior. We compare ANN to three other classification methods and show the advantages of ANN for detection of known worms. We then proceed to evaluate ANN‚Äôs ability to detect the presence of an unknown worm. As the measurement of a large number of system features may require significant computational resources, we evaluate three feature selection techniques. We show that, using only five features, one can detect an unknown worm with an average accuracy of 90%. We use a causal index analysis of our trained ANN to identify rules that explain the relationships between the selected features and the identity of each worm. Finally, we discuss the possible application of our approach to host-based intrusion detection systems."

        "description": "The recent growth in network usage has motivated the creation of new malicious code for various purposes. Today‚Äôs signature-based antiviruses are very accurate for known malicious code, but can not detect new malicious code. Recently, classification algorithms were used successfully for the detection of unknown malicious code. But, these studies involved a test collection with a limited size and the same malicious: benign file ratio in both the training and test sets, a situation which does not reflect real-life conditions. We present a methodology for the detection of unknown malicious code, which examines concepts from text categorization, based on n-grams extraction from the binary code and feature selection. We performed an extensive evaluation, consisting of a test collection of more than 30,000 files, in which we investigated the class imbalance problem. In real-life scenarios, the malicious file content is expected to be low, about 10% of the total files. For practical purposes, it is unclear as to what the corresponding percentage in the training set should be. Our results indicate that greater than 95% accuracy can be achieved through the use of a training set that has a malicious file content of less than 33.3%."

        "description": "Detecting unknown worms is a challenging task. Extant solutions, such as anti-virus tools, rely mainly on prior explicit knowledge of specific worm signatures. As a result, after the appearance of a new worm on the Web there is a significant delay until an update carrying the worm's signature is distributed to anti-virus tools. During this time interval a new worm can infect many computers and create significant damage. We propose an innovative technique for detecting the presence of an unknown worm, not necessarily by recognizing specific instances of the worm, but rather based on the computer measurements. We designed an experiment to test the new technique employing several computer configurations and background applications activity. During the experiments 323 computer features were monitored. Four feature selection techniques were used to reduce the amount of features and four classification algorithms were applied on the resulting feature subsets. Our results indicate that using this approach resulted, in above 90% average accuracy, and for specific unknown worms accuracy reached above 99%, using just 20 features while maintaining a low level of false positive rate"

Current common solutions, such as anti-virus tools, rely heavily on prior explicit knowledge of specific instances of malcode binary code signatures. During the time between its appearance and an update being sent to anti-virus tools, a new worm can infect many computers and cause significant damage. We present a new host-based intrusion detection approach, based on analyzing the behavior of the computer to detect the presence of unknown malicious code. The new approach consists on classification algorithms that learn from previous known malcode samples which enable the detection of an unknown malcode. We performed several experiments to evaluate our approach, focusing on computer worms being activated on several computer configurations while running several programs in order to simulate background activity. We collected 323 features in order to measure the computer behavior. Four classification algorithms were applied on several feature subsets. The average detection accuracy that we achieved was above 90% and for specific unknown worms even above 99%."

Commonly this task is performed by antivirus software tools that rely on prior explicit knowledge of the worm's code, which is represented by signatures. We present a new approach based on artificial neural networks (ANN) for detecting the presence of computer worms based on the computer's behavioral measures. In order to evaluate the new approach, several computers were infected with seven different worms and more than sixty different parameters of the infected computers were measured. The ANN and two other known classifications techniques, decision tree and k-nearest neighbors, were used to test their ability to classify correctly the presence, and the type, of the computer worms even during heavy user activity on the infected computers. The comparisons between the three approaches suggest that the ANN approach have computational advantages when real-time computation is needed, and has the potential to detect previously unknown worms. In addition, ANN may be used to identify the most relevant, measurable, features and thus reduce the feature dimensionality."

        "subtitle": "Proceedings of the 4th World Congress of Computers in Agriculture and Natural Resources",
        "date": "2006",
        "description": "Conditions for the infection of apple and pear by Erwinia amylovora, the causal agent of FireBlight, were investigated and modeled by plant pathologists in different places in the world. Examples include: MARYBLYT (Steiner & Lightner, 1996), BIS95 (Billing, 1996), FBCA (Shtienberg et al, 1998). Interestingly, the outputs of these models, which are targeted to predict disease risk, even based on same data, are different. Recently, fire-blight appeared on a few infected trees in Trentino, Italy. An attempt to identify dates and sites with high disease infection probability, based on known models developed in other places (Maryblyt, Bis95, FBCA) resulted in low estimation accuracy of the true events. Evidently, the models do not sufficiently consider the particularity of the region nor can they consider other factors such as the inoculum's distribution. Therefore an innovative approach was attempted to answer the challenge of extracting a model based on rare examples of infected trees and the region meteorological data, to identify the vulnerable areas within specific periods, in which Fire-Blight infection can occur in Trentino. We used artificial neural networks (Bishop, 1995) in order to cluster the given data including meteorological data, geographical properties and infected trees over two periods of time: blooming and prior-infection period. The infected stations at both periods concentrated in the 20-30% of the clusters, from which we extracted the features values in which the infection may occur. We found that all the temperature measures were relatively low, for infected clusters, and that the height was high. In the blooming period leaf-wetness and degree hours were relatively low."

Anode hosts today a multitude of Microsoft projects and used by 10s of engineerins within the company.The platform uses git-based deployment to provide a super fast development turn around (~30 sec) as oppose to what was conventional at Microsoft beforehand (weekly).We have published a few open source libraries as part of the project and contributed as a participant in the internal Microsoft node.js community (Azure, node.js port to Windows, etc).I have conceptualized and built some unique features such as deployment of multiple branches to the cloud (allow spawning isolated environments for feature development quickly), distributed api testing, github continuous deployment bots."

I would recommend having him on the team because he is proactive, problem solver, and has deep mobile marketing knowledge. He is a kind person, it would be an honor for me to re-cooperate with him in the future.‚Äù",
      "Stoyan Gogov ‚ÄúI've met a lot of people in the mobile advertising industry. Yoav is one of the few ones, that I liked working with. He is really organized, motivated and eager to learn. One of the best qualities he has is probably to listen & understand. Many account managers out there are lacking these fundamental skills, that are more than important in our field. Yoav knows how to plan, analyze and execute. :) ‚Äù"

      "Sarah de Lange ‚ÄúI know Dmitri ( though I call him Dima) as a hard-working, smart, creative and very friendly developer. In my role as Product Owner we worked together closely even though we were based in different countries and I really enjoyed this collaboration. Dima is a true teamplayer, always ready to lend a hand or come up with alternative solutions if the situation requires it. I will miss working with him and I hope we will work together again in the future. A company would be lucky to have him on board!‚Äù",
      "LinkedIn User ‚ÄúIt was wonderful to work together with Dima, who was an outstanding Team Leader. It was great for me to work with him for more than two years. He is ready to deal with difficult situations and solve the problems on time. Dima proved to be essential to the team, and contributed significantly to the success of the company.He is a truly extraordinary individual.‚Äù"

      "Gil Tamir ‚ÄúI highly recommend Omer as an exceptional individual, both as a friend and a colleague. Over the course of our two-year period at Razor Labs, I have come to appreciate his reliability, fun nature, and wisdom (beyond his years). Omer possesses outstanding qualities as a brilliant autodidact, fast learner, and can-do person who is always eager to learn and evolve. His contributions at Razor Labs were remarkable, as he successfully tackled various IoT challenges in the realm of Industry 4.0, such as heavy machinery condition monitoring and forecasting, utilizing a combination of statistical and physical modeling. Omer had a direct impact on the company's business state by deploying these models for strategic partners, while also providing guidance to the BizDev department, showcasing his exceptional emotional intelligence, relatability, reliability, and excellent decision-making skills. Additionally, his diverse recreational interests contribute to his creative thinking and overall success in both career and life.‚Äù",
      "LinkedIn User ‚ÄúI mentored Omer during his internship at Kando. During this time he showed strong programming skills and data science understanding. Omer worked very independently on a difficult binary classification project. In the process he developed a set of tools for internal use by the DS team. I enjoyed working with him and gladly recommend him professionally and personally.‚Äù"

      "Tal Zach ‚ÄúWorked closely with Mor for a while, and I can say she is one of the best developers I've come across with. She is an exceptionally fast learner, brings her heart and soul to every task she's given, and is a pleasure to work with. Mor is always up for learning new things, and she excels them very quickly. I highly recommend Mor, and I know every team will be fortunate to have her.‚Äù",
      "Gabriel Amram ‚ÄúI had the pleasure of working with Mor for several months at Brew. During that time, I was consistently impressed with her abilities - quick learning, social skills and fast understanding of a complex system. Mor was able to quickly learn the codebase and the different systems that we use. She was also able to quickly understand the different moving parts of our projects and how they all fit together. This allowed her to make significant contributions to our team, even though she was \"only\" a junior engineer. For example, though she mainly came from Front-end technologies she learned both back-end and cloud infrastructure quickly and thoroughly. Mor is also a very social person. She is well-liked by both her peers and managers. She is always willing to help others and she is always up for a challenge. She is also a great communicator and she is able to clearly explain complex technical concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences. She worked closely with the CTO (myself), product team and the entire engineering team. I believe that Mor would be a valuable asset to any team. She is a quick learner, she is a team player, and she is a great communicator. I highly recommend her for any position and envy any company that would be lucky enough to work with Mor.‚Äù"

      "Danny Rosenberg ‚ÄúI had the honor of working closely with Guy, being a Frontend Developer at Kape while I was the Product Marketing Manager and I can tell that Guy is a terrific person to work with. Guy consistently demonstrated a solid work ethic and a commitment to business success. Give him the really challenging tasks, the ones that everyone else is struggling with, and he will get them done. During our work together, Guy was showing a great set of skills in problem-solving and was always getting things done fast and accurately. In addition, Guy is a very fun person to work with and he would be an asset to any organization. It was a true pleasure to work with Guy and I really hope we will have a chance to work together again.‚Äù",

      "Jodi Yanovich ‚ÄúI highly recommend Eli for any senior technical support role. Despite only being with Base for a short time, his impact has been truly impressive. Eli is a quick learner who consistently grasps new concepts and technologies rapidly. This, combined with his ability to solve technical issues efficiently and effectively and his excellent interpersonal skills, make it a pleasure for both colleagues and clients to work with him. I have no doubt that he will continue to excel in any technical support or customer facing environment.‚Äù",
      "Tom Levanon Samara ‚ÄúNot only Eli is a great colleague, but he is also a true professional, highly motivated, and fully dedicated person. I had the pleasure to work alongside Eli on the Customer Support teams, where he could help us with clients' technical questions, providing a great service with a smile. I believe Eli will be a great asset to any team!‚Äù"

She can easily understand the needs of the organization and find the best candidates who will fit the position. She also pushed for changes in the talent org including better methodologies, reports, and overall looks for everything that can be better. She also made sure no ball was dropped in the process and made sure everyone (from hiring managers, talent aquisition, interviewers, candidates, etc) did they part in the best way possible.

        "subtitle": "IEEE Transactions on signal processing",
        "date": "January 7, 2022",
        "description": "This paper studies streaming optimization problems that have objectives of the form ‚àë_{t=1}^T f_t(x_{t‚àí1},x_t). In particular, we are interested in how the solution x^_{t|T} for the t-th frame of variables changes as T increases. While incrementing T and adding a new functional and a new set of variables does in general change the solution everywhere, we give conditions under which x^_{t|T} converges to a limit point x_{t}^* at a linear rate as T‚Üí‚àû. As a consequence, we are able to derive theoretical guarantees for algorithms with limited memory, showing that limiting the solution updates to only a small number of frames in the past sacrifices almost nothing in accuracy. We also present a new efficient Newton online algorithm (NOA), inspired by these results, that updates the solution with fixed complexity of O(3Bn3), independent of T, where B corresponds to how far in the past the variables are updated, and n is the size of a single block-vector. Two streaming optimization examples, online reconstruction from non-uniform samples and non-homogeneous Poisson intensity estimation, support the theoretical results and show how the algorithm can be used in practice."

        "date": "June 22, 2019",
        "description": "In recent years, several designs that use in-memory processing to accelerate machine learning inference problems have been proposed. Such designs are also a perfect fit for discrete, dynamic,and distributed systems that can solve large-dimensional optimization problems using iterative algorithms.For in-memory computations, ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FerroFETs) owing to their compact areaand distinguishable multiple states offer promising possibilities. We present a distributed architecture thatuses FerroFET memory and implements in-memory processing to solve a template problem of least squaresminimization. Through this architecture, we demonstrate an improvement of 21√ó in energy efficiencyand 3√ó in compute time compared to a static random access memory (SRAM)-based processing-in memory (PIM) architecture."

        "subtitle": "IEEE",
        "date": "April 16, 2019",
        "description": "Optimization problems form the basis of a wide gamut of computationally challenging tasks in signal processing, machine learning, resource planning and so on. Out of these, convex optimization, and in particular least square optimization, covers a vast majority; and recent advances in iterative algorithms to solve such problems of large dimensions have gained traction. Multi-core designs with systolic or semi-systolic architectures can be a key enabler for implementing discrete dynamical systems and realize massively scalable architectures to solve such optimization algorithms. In this paper, we present a platform architecture implemented in programmable FPGA hardware to solve a template problem in distributed optimization, namely signal reconstruction from non-uniform sampling. This is a quintessential problem with wide-spread applications in signal processing, computational imaging etc. We expect such an architectural exploration to open up promising opportunities to solve distributed optimizations that are becoming increasingly important in real-world applications. The complete system design, mapping and optimization into an FPGA architecture as well as analysis of convergence and scalability have been presented."

      "Igor Cher ‚ÄúIsrael is an extremely valuable and multi-talented QA Engineer. He can easily find and to point out of real cause of most complex and intricate bugs. In all that relates to our interaction (web services, XMLs, HTTP, sniffers, logs, and many other things) he demonstrates outstanding knowledge. I'm truly looking forward to work together again and would recommend Israel for a challenging R&D position!‚Äù",
      "Yossi Sition ‚ÄúI worked with Israel at HOT and was impressed with this work. Israel brought his wealth of experience and applied himself wholeheartedly for converting manual tests into automated scripts (HP LoadRunner, QTP). Thanks to Israel, we found unexpected problems during the transition to new DB version in combination with various company systems (Billing, CRM etc.). I am pleased to recommend Israel Kliger for his commitment to quality!‚Äù"

Eliran's dedication drives constant improvement, making the team more efficient and customer-focused. He's also skilled at setting up monitoring tools, giving his management insights into the team‚Äôs KPIs and support quality. Eliran has also managed our company's knowledge center, where he ensures that valuable information is organized and accessible to all team members. His strategic approach to knowledge management has streamlined the team‚Äôs processes and improved collaboration across departments. Overall, Eliran is an outstanding leader with technical expertise and a genuine commitment to his team's success.‚Äù",
      "Ben Chan ‚ÄúEliran was an integral part of up-skilling members of the new Vimeo APAC office. Despite being in a different region, I worked closely with Eliran and he was always patient and ever-ready to explain things, and more importantly re-explain things if I did not understand it the first time around. This proved to be exceptionally crucial as it allowed myself, and the larger APAC, team to very quickly get a good understanding of what the product is capable of, and thus allowed us to be more confident in our customer conversations. Eliran's is extremely personable and approachable, and I am confident that anyone working with him would say the same. It has been a pleasure working with Elira and I wish him all the best in his future adventures.‚Äù"

      "Avshi Avital ‚ÄúUri has been my peer and manager for a few years, and I can say with confidence that he is the best manager I‚Äôve had the privilege to work with. He is strong on all the PPPT fronts: People, Project, Product and Technology, and is one of those rare people that can see both the trees and the forest - that are able to get down into the technical details: design decisions, deep architectural discussions, while maintaining a strong hold on the overall direction of the project. It is the last year and a half that I‚Äôve seen Uri at his best. After the team moved to VMware, we built a new product from scratch. Uri has mobilized a team that has recently joined VMware and was in need of a new focus, into architecting a new product while implementing the scrum methodology. Under his leadership, the team pioneered on multiple fronts, building a revolutionary product, using state of the art technology, with a continuous build and integration process, and while spearheading scrum implementation - acting as a model to other teams at VMware. A testament to the strong team he‚Äôs built is the fact that the team continues to improve and deliver even after he has left the team. Above all, Uri truly cares about and understands people. He understands what motivates the people in his team, both on a personal and a professional level. He is able to care for them while challenging them to give their best. This is evident in the strong personal relationships that he has built and that he‚Äôs continuing to maintain throughout his career, and in the highly performing team that he has managed to build. I feel privileged for having worked with Uri, and I‚Äôm convinced that he will be key to the success of any organization that is lucky enough to work with him.‚Äù",
      "Ran Eitan ‚ÄúUri and I go a long way back. We have worked since the early days of nLayers startup as colleagues leading core teams, building-up the team and product and exchanged managerial roles throughout the development of the company until acquired by EMC and VMware. I have had the chance to work closely with Uri for 7 years and see him through times when true leadership and charisma were an essential ingredient to someone who manages R&D groups. During times of urgency, Uri with his calm and open personality was able to take hard decision while taking in all management teams' input and meet those un-feasible challenges with high standards and quality. It was an honor working with Uri. Ran‚Äù"

        "subtitle": "Nature Communications",
        "date": "2020",
        "description": "Endosomes are compositionally dynamic organelles that regulate signaling, nutrient status and organelle quality by specifying whether material entering the cells will be shuttled back to the cell surface or degraded by the lysosome. Recently, membrane contact sites (MCSs) between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and endosomes have emerged as important players in endosomal protein sorting, dynamics and motility. Here, we show that PDZD8, a Synaptotagmin-like Mitochondrial lipid-binding Proteins (SMP) domain-containing ER transmembrane protein, utilizes distinct domains to interact with Rab7-GTP and the ER transmembrane protein Protrudin and together these components localize to an ER-late endosome MCS. At these ER-late endosome MCSs, mitochondria are also recruited to form a three-way contact. Thus, our data indicate that PDZD8 is a shared component of two distinct MCSs and suggest a role for SMP-mediated lipid transport in the regulation of endosome function."

        "subtitle": "Journal of Cell Biology",
        "date": "2018",
        "description": "Genome duplication in eukaryotes created paralog pairs of ribosomal proteins (RPs) that show high sequence similarity/identity. However, individual paralogs can confer vastly different effects upon cellular processes, e.g., specific yeast paralogs regulate actin organization, bud site selection, and mRNA localization, although how specificity is conferred is unknown. Changes in the RP composition of ribosomes might allow for specialized translation of different subsets of mRNAs, yet it is unclear whether specialized ribosomes exist and if paralog specificity controls translation. Using translatome analyses, we show that the translation of mitochondrial proteins is highly down-regulated in yeast lacking RP paralogs required for normal mitochondrial function (e.g., RPL1b). Although RPL1a and RPL1b encode identical proteins, Rpl1b-containing ribosomes confer more efficient translation of respiration-related proteins. Thus, ribosomes varying in RP composition may confer specialized functions, and RP paralog specificity defines a novel means of translational control."

        "description": "Dendritic polymer nanoparticles (NPs) are promising vehicles for drug delivery. Most dendrimer polymer NPs, however, exhibit positive surface charge which make them, in many instances, cytotoxic. We constructed noncationic, amphiphilic dendrimer NPs embedding curcumin and resveratrol, natural polyphenols exhibiting anticancer properties. The curcumin/resveratrol/dendrimer NPs both effectively shielded the embedded polyphenols and facilitated their slow release and, notably, targeted cancer cells. The experimental data trace the cancer cell toxicity of the curcumin/resveratrol/dendrimer NPs to impairment of mitochondrial functions, specifically giving rise to enhanced intracellular calcium release, inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase enzyme activity, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochondrial membrane perturbation. Importantly, synergism between the dendrimer-NP-embedded curcumin and resveratrol was observed, as more pronounced cancer cell death and mitochondrial disruption were induced by the curcumin/resveratrol/dendrimer NPs as compared to either the freely dissolved polyphenols or amphiphilic dendrimer NPs incorporating curcumin or resveratrol separately. This work suggests that amphiphilic dendrimer NPs encapsulating curcumin and resveratrol may constitute a promising anticancer therapeutic platform."

        "subtitle": "May Meltzer, Noam Eliash, Ziv Azoulay, Uzi Hadad & Niv Papo",
        "date": "May 23, 2022",
        "description": "The human signaling molecules Tie1 and Tie2 receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) play important pathophysiological roles in many diseases, including different cancers. The activity of Tie1 is mediated mainly through the downstream angiopoietin-1 (Ang1)-dependent activation of Tie2, rendering both Tie 1 and the Tie1/Tie2/Ang1 axis attractive putative targets for therapeutic intervention. However, the development of inhibitors that target Tie1 and an understanding of their effect on Tie2 and on the Tie1/Tie2/Ang1 axis remain unfulfilled tasks, due, largely, to the facts that Tie1 is an orphan receptor and is difficult to produce and use in the quantities required for immune antibody library screens. In a search for a selective inhibitor of this orphan receptor, we sought to exploit the advantages (e.g., small size that allows binding to hidden epitopes) of non-immune nanobodies and to simultaneously overcome their limitations (i.e., low expression and stability). We thus performed expression, stability, and affinity screens of yeast-surface-displayed na√Øve and predesigned synthetic (non-immune) nanobody libraries against the Tie1 extracellular domain. The screens yielded a nanobody with high expression and good affinity and specificity for Tie1, thereby yielding preferential binding for Tie1 over Tie2. The stability, selectivity, potency, and therapeutic potential of this synthetic nanobody were profiled using in vitro and cell-based assays. The nanobody triggered Tie1-dependent inhibition of RTK (Tie2, Akt, and Fak) phosphorylation and angiogenesis in endothelial cells, as well as suppression of human glioblastoma cell viability and migration. This study opens the way to developing nanobodies as therapeutics for different cancers associated with Tie1 activation."

        "subtitle": "Meltzer M, Zvagelsky T, Hadad U, Papo N & Engel S.",
        "date": "May 23, 2022",
        "description": "The immense potential of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) as targets for drug discovery is not fully realized due to the enormous difficulties associated with structure elucidation of these profoundly unstable membrane proteins. The existing methods of GPCR stability-engineering are cumbersome and low-throughput; in addition, the scope of GPCRs that could benefit from these techniques is limited. Here, we present a yeast-based screening platform for a single-step isolation of GRCR variants stable in the presence of short-chain detergents, a feature essential for their successful crystallization using vapor diffusion method. The yeast detergent-resistant cell wall presents a unique opportunity for compartmentalization, to physically link the receptor's phenotype to its encoding DNA, and thus enable discovery of stable GPCR variants with unprecedent efficiency. The scope of mutations identified by the method reveals a surprising amenability of the GPCR scaffold to stabilization, and suggests an intriguing possibility of amending the stability properties of GPCR by varying the structural status of the C-terminus."

Nicole quickly grasped everything, and was able to pinpoint the critical questions. In a short meeting, she was able to identify the relevant pieces of information in a vast new field, convey them very clearly, and followed that up with the right introduction, that is about to be realized into cooperation soon. Along that, Nicole was communicative and friendly, which I consider at least as important.‚Äù"

Today there are many Facebook posts about available apartments to rent.When looking for one in those groups, you go through the same process - Searching in each group you are familiar with, and manually checking whether the apartment is suitable to your needs.This project does this process automatically and can help you find your next ideal apartment!This project - - Scrapes data from Facebook rental groups - Extracts details through #openai Function Calling API - Filters them by a set of easily defined rules - Sends selected apartments to a chosen Telegram groupThe #openai Function Calling API saves all the trouble from writing a custom logic that parses the needed details from each post (E.g. - how to extract the number of rooms written in the post? Will it be a number? will it be \"3 rooms\"?) and I recommend giving it a try with other use cases you may encounter."

      "Assaf Priel ‚ÄúShira has been an invaluable asset to our team and an exceptional professional in every sense of the word. Initially, we contacted Shira to utilize her expertise as a UX consultant for a critical project. Her mission was to create a web-based presentation tool to enable our salespersons to excel in remote sales, showcasing the company and its renovation projects. Shira's proficiency and dedication were evident from the very beginning. She approached the task with enthusiasm and delivered outstanding results. Thanks to her efforts, the tool she crafted not only saved our renovation experts a substantial amount of time but also significantly enhanced their ability to engage in more sales meetings successfully. Due to her excellent performance and the positive impact on the team, we decided to bring Shira on board as a full-time employee. Her responsibilities expanded, and she accepted the challenge of leading part of our technology transformation efforts. Shira played a pivotal role in managing the complex project of replacing our accounting and procurement systems, demonstrating remarkable project management skills and exceptional problem-solving abilities throughout. Shira exhibits impressive attention to detail in every task she undertakes and is incredibly organized, ensuring that no aspect is overlooked. Working with Shira has always been a pleasure; she is not only a reliable and cooperative team member but also a delightful colleague.‚Äù",

It was evident from the get-go that Yossi possesses exceptional interpersonal skills, he played a major role in ramping up new team members and was always easy to approach and ready to help. Yossi is a sharp and quick thinker with impressive self-learning abilities that can tackle complicated tasks requiring research. I could always trust that he would take full ownership of his tasks and projects and raise flags on time. Over time he grew his field of responsibilities and established a security-oriented dev team, recruited more people, and led it. It was a pleasure working with Yossi and I can full-heartedly recommend him to any future employer.‚Äù",
      "Niv Peled ‚ÄúI highly recommend Yossi as a valuable team player with exceptional cybersecurity knowledge. During our collaboration in the OT security group, Yossi consistently demonstrated initiative, strong leadership, and a mentorship spirit. His proficiency in Python coding and debugging greatly contributed to our team's success. Yossi's positive attitude, paired with his friendly demeanor and ever-present smile, make him a pleasure to work with. I look forward to the opportunity to work alongside Yossi again in the future.‚Äù"

      "LinkedIn User ‚ÄúWorking with Zohar was a pleasure. He is a very charismatic and detail oriented person with an excellent business sense, which as a developer helped him to create products that not just worked, but that customers wanted to buy. This fact is more impressive considering the products Zohar created were 5-10 times the cost of any other product sold by Check Point Software and yet no one on the sales teams had any problem selling them. Zohar spent much of his time traveling and soliciting feedback from partners, customers, and the regional sales teams in order to create the best products in the marketplace. He is excellent at customer support and follow up, and talking complicated solutions and breaking them down into simplified products that anyone can use or understand. Given the chance I would work with Zohar again in a minute.‚Äù"

Yael is that type of person when it comes to blockchain and tokenization technologies. I had the pleasure of working with Yael and her tech startup during her residency at the Expert Dojo International Accelerator. Providing training around personal branding, I was able to learn more about Yael's unique past, and I was both humbled and impressed learning all that she has accomplished. A role model for other founders, she is hyper-focused on solving global problems through technology. Her passion is clear, and I see great things for her and her company. If you are interested in applications of blockchain that have a massive impact, it is worth connecting with Yael and learning more about her journey, and how she sees the future. ‚Äù",
      "Thabiso Kgabung ‚ÄúI had the pleasure of interviewing Yael as part of our organisation's blog segment titled 'Women In Marketing'. Not only was I exposed to Yael's responsibilities as Solidblock's CMO, but I was also exposed to her personal side. She is a wonderful being and brings immense value to the team. ‚Äù"

      "Guy Katsovich ‚ÄúAs Fusion VC continue to support Preseed Israeli Start-Ups, it is crucial that I continue to provide the best resources for my portfolio companies to succeed. One of the tougher elements of the journey for many Israeli founders is to understand the sales journey from discovery call to close. Often, they come from a technical background and lack the experience to effectively run a full Sales Cycle. I have turned to Elisha as a sales development coach and mentor for my portfolio companies. Elisha is an interactive, entertaining, and engaging presenter who challenges the founders. He has the unique blend of emotional intelligence and technical best practices to build rapport and trust with the founders. During his workshops and 1:1 sessions, Elisha works with founders to build their persona maps, establish a simple, clear buyer journey and learn how to structure an impactful discovery call whilst being able to overcome any objection with a challenger mindset. Sales at this stage are fundamental to the success of our companies. Elisha is the person I trust to help our founders succeed.‚Äù",
      "Jim Roughan ‚ÄúI worked alongside Elisha and his team, whilst at Akamai (Guardicore). What struck me was his ability to bring in new hires and enable them to have an incredibly quick impact. I believe that is testament to his coaching and leadership style. he really creates and empowers a team to achieve amazing things. The culture within his team of direct reports is fabulous, he leads from the front and goes on the journey with each and every one of his team.‚Äù"

I picked my device (although it was still alive!) and began to understand what is going on.As I read Samsung's alleged patch to fix the problem, it turned out that the device's embedded eMMC chip is to blame. As I made some clever guesses and used a little bit of magic, I was able to dump the entire firmware of the chip, which appeared to sport an ARM Cortex-M3 core inside.As I went deeper into the firmware, I understood what the bug was and what Samsung was trying to do - stall the device whenever it encounters the bug, instead of fixing it!I wrote a program which low level formats the device in order to avoid the bug. I also added a field upgrade feature so that one may upgrade his eMMC firmware to fix it."

Other than its primary feature - support for booting a Linux kernel, OpeniBoot provides much more features as compared to the native iBoot.I developed the Flash Translation Layer (FTL) which is 100% compatible with Apple's implementation. This allows us to run Linux alongside iOS on the same device.In addition I developed some other drivers such as the Power Management Unit (PMU) driver.Since most of the iPhone's hardware is not publicly documented, during the development we had to use techniques such as black-box debugging and clean room reverse engineering. Furthermore, I wrote an infrastructure which patches iBoot and seamlessly installs traces in order to understand its inner logic."

I had the pleasure of working with Guy for 6 months on a huge B2C marketing strategy campaign in the online / internet industry. Guy is wonderful to work with, and has a exceptional marketing, and leadership expertise. His qualities and creativity allowed us to take a complex project and break it to simple, easy-to-perform tasks. It was magnificent! and I could not avoid the way his teammates admired his insights and knowledge. Guy made sure everyone made the work with a smile and knew what they should be doing to make the project work. As a leader (CEO or any other managerial position), Guy earns my highest recommendation! Go Guy! ‚Äù",

      "Carmela Abraham ‚ÄúI met Shiran during my sabbatical from Boston University School of Medicine at Tel Aviv University where I collaborated with her principle investigator. Shiran is an outstanding researcher judged by her capabilities, achievements and motivation and possesses high intellectual and analytical skills. She is also very dedicated, exhibits initiative and creativity and is prepared to invest all the effort and hard work necessary to translate her ideas into reality. During her graduate studies she worked on multidisciplinary assays and published six articles in major journals, with five as first author, which is the best proof to her tremendous productivity. I have also had the pleasure of hearing her talks at numerous national and international venues and was very impressed with her presentation skills. ‚Äù"

        "date": "September 22, 2023",
        "description": "Alzheimer‚Äôs disease (AD) is characterized by toxic protein accumulation in the brain. Ubiquitination is essential for protein clearance in cells, making altered ubiquitin signaling crucial in AD development. A defective variant, ubiquitin B‚Äâ+‚Äâ1 (UBB+1), created by a non-hereditary RNA frameshift mutation, is found in all AD patient brains post-mortem. We now detect UBB+1¬†in human brains during early AD stages. Our study employs a 3D neural culture platform derived from human neural progenitors, demonstrating that UBB+1¬†alone induces extracellular amyloid-Œ≤ (AŒ≤) deposits and insoluble hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates. UBB+1¬†competes with ubiquitin for binding to the deubiquitinating enzyme UCHL1, leading to elevated levels of amyloid precursor protein (APP), secreted AŒ≤ peptides, and AŒ≤ build-up. Crucially, silencing UBB+1¬†expression impedes the emergence of AD hallmarks in this model system. Our findings highlight the significance of ubiquitin signalling as a variable contributing to AD pathology and present a nonclinical platform for testing potential therapeutics."

While working in our first company (GrocerKey) Leora quickly advanced from just starting in the QA team to becoming the Team Lead and delegating tasks efficiently all while working with the dev team to ensure proper testing would take place on future tasks. I am constantly surprised by the quick understanding Leora has when working on a new project and product and how easily she can break it down into test cases. She has a clear understanding of test cases and using all the tools to manage them, from JIRA to TestRail and everything in between. Leora is a huge asset to any QA department she is part of and should be an easy choice for any hiring manager seeking to improve their QA coverage as a whole.‚Äù"

We use time-lapse images of NIH3T3 scratch assay cultures, extract patches around bright candidate regions that then undergo segmentation and binarization, followed by a classification of the binary patches into either containing or not containing cell division. The classification is performed by training a Convolutional Neural Network on a specially constructed database. We show strong results of AUC = 0.91 and F-score = 0.89, competitive with state-of-the-art methods in this field."

        "subtitle": "Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience",
        "date": "October 1, 2019",
        "description": "Precise cerebral dynamics of action of the anesthetics are a challenge for neuroscientists. This explains why there is no gold standard for monitoring the Depth of Anesthesia (DoA) and why experimental studies may use several electroencephalogram (EEG) channels, ranging from 2 to 128 EEG-channels. Our study aimed at finding the scalp area providing valuable information about brain activity under general anesthesia (GA) to select the more optimal EEG channel to characterized the DoA. We included 30 patients undergoing elective, minor surgery under GA and used a 32-channel EEG to record their electrical brain activity. In addition, we recorded their physiological parameters and the BIS monitor. Each individual EEG channel data were processed to test their ability to differentiate awake from asleep states. Due to strict quality criteria adopted for the EEG data and the difficulties of the real-life setting of the study, only 8 patients recordings were taken into consideration in the final analysis. Using 2 classification algorithms, we identified the optimal channels to discriminate between asleep and awake states: the frontal and temporal F8 and T7 were retrieved as being the two bests channels to monitor DoA. Then, using only data from the F8 channel, we tried to minimize the number of features required to discriminate between the awake and asleep state. The best algorithm turned out to be the Gaussian Na√Øve Bayes (GNB) requiring only 5 features (Area Under the ROC Curve - AUC- of 0.93 ¬± 0.04). This finding may pave the way to improve the assessment of DoA by combining one EEG channel recordings with a multimodal physiological monitoring of the brain state under GA. Further work is needed to see if these results may be valid to asses the depth of sedation in ICU."

His methodology throughout the process was highly effective in fast tracking us in the design process. This meant that we were ready for a very successful client validation phase in half the time. His insight and ingenuity expanded the scope of the project, which led to the product becoming a pivotal part of a newly laid strategy in one of our business streams. The final deliverable was expertly put together, and the professional and attentive attitude throughout the process meant we were all grateful to his contribution. I can‚Äôt recommend him enough! ‚Äù",

Being extremely sharp and smart, a perfectionist in everything she does, while always having a smile. It is this unique mix of capabilities together with her being one of the best \"people person\" I've worked with, that ensures her success. During her time as Camilyo's HR manager Chen have successfully introduced new standards of running this department, from recruiting, to employee development, compensations to the many social activities she lead. We were all sad to see her go and take on another, bigger challenge. Chen is an asset to any organization looking to have a killer HR Manager. I am certain any organization will benefit immensely from having Chen around. ‚Äù",
      "Gil Tov-Ly ‚ÄúI've had the privilege of working with Chen at ClicksMob for 1.5 years, where I witnessed her building ClicksMob's HR department from the ground up. During her time at ClicksMob, Chen instilled a unique company culture, formulated and refined hiring and training protocols, created great education programs and more. Chen masterfully created an amazing sense of belonging - making us all proud to be ClicksMob employees. I am confident that Chen would shine in any challenge she chooses to undertake.‚Äù"

She was the offshore mgr who helped the China team to rebuild the QA framework, re-set the mindset and re-shape the team's mission. Also she is a very strong mentor capable of pointing out the unknown issues and help you to figure out how to fix them. She is indeed a strong QA professional and a very successful manager who can inspire and influce the people around her. It's a big pleasure to work with Ofrit.‚Äù",
      "Benny Keinan ‚ÄúOfrit joined 48Upper team from the beginning. At that time, there were many unknowns that we had to handle. Ofrit took a significant part on creating the environment that was used to build the product on. Ofrit dived into many areas that she was not familiar with, and managed to learn things quickly. Ofrit is highly effective, extremely fun to work with, a real partner to consult and a true team player. I will be happy to have Ofrit on my team anytime.‚Äù"

      "Sara Mirowitz ‚ÄúI had the incredible fortune of working alongside Aviad in our design team for the past year. Aviad is an exceptional product designer who brings a unique combination of technical skills, kindness, and a strong work ethic to the table. Throughout my time working with him, I was continually impressed by his ability to see the big picture, his eagerness to take initiative and responsibility, his deep commitment to his work, and his willingness to help those around him. It's this willingness to help others that I believe really sets Aviad apart. Aviad is an incredibly kind, talented, and humble person who leads by example and inspires others with his positive attitude and work ethic. While his design talent speaks for itself, Aviad consistently went above and beyond to share those talents by offering guidance and support to his colleagues. I consider myself incredibly blessed to have had the opportunity to learn from him. One project that stands out in particular is Aviad's work on our company's design system. He took ownership of the project and put in countless hours to rebuild our components from the ground up. His regular meetings with R&D were crucial in driving the design system forward and helping us move towards our goal of having a polished and robust design system that the whole company can benefit from. I feel incredibly grateful to have had the opportunity to work with Aviad and I cannot recommend him highly enough for any design role. I would jump at the chance to be able to work with Aviad again, and I hope we cross paths again soon!‚Äù"

        "subtitle": "2022 31st IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (RO-MAN)",
        "date": "August 29, 2022",
        "description": "The role of social robots as advisors for decision making is investigated. It has been consistently shown that when asked to rank options, people often make fallacious judgements. Furthermore, such fallacies can be sensitive to presentation mode. We study whether having social robot advisors presenting options can mitigate and reduce the fallacy rates of participants. For this purpose we explored a novel presentation mode of options with conjunction judgmental fallacy, namely, choosing among different rank-orders, as opposed to rank the options themselves. We first show that the mere presentation mode has a significant mitigating effect on the fallacy rates. We then further show that when social robot advisors present the rank-orders, the fallacy rates of participants significantly decrease even further. Moreover, participants perceive the fallacious robot as more likeable and intelligent, but assign the non-fallacious robot to trustworthy roles, such as jury and analyst. These results suggest that social robot advisors may be used to influence and mitigate human fallacious judgmental decision making."

        "description": "The role of social robots as advisors for decision-making is investigated. We examined how a robot advisor with logical reasoning and one with cognitive fallacies affected participants‚Äô decision-making in different contexts. The participants were asked to make multiple decisions while receiving advice from both robots during the decision-making process. Participants had to choose which robot they agreed with and, at the end of the scenario, rank the possible options presented to them. After the interaction, participants were asked to assign jobs to the robots, e.g. jury or bartender. Based on the ‚Äòlike-me‚Äô hypothesis and previous research of social mitigation of fallacious judgmental decisions, we have compared participants‚Äô agreement with the two robots for each scenario to random choice using t-tests, as well as analysed the dynamical nature of the interaction, e.g. whether participants changed their choices based on the robots‚Äô verbal opinion using Pearson correlations. Our results show that the robots had an effect on the participants‚Äô responses, regardless of the robots‚Äô fallaciousness, wherein participants changed their decisions based on the robot they agreed with more. Moreover, the context, presented as two different scenarios, also had an effect on the preferred robots, wherein an art auction scenario resulted in significantly increased agreement with the fallacious robot, whereas a detective scenario did not. Finally, an exploratory analysis showed that personality traits, e.g. agreeableness and neuroticism, and attitudes towards robots had an impact on which robot was assigned to these jobs. Taken together, the results presented here show that social robots‚Äô effects on participants‚Äô decision-making involve complex interactions between the context, the cognitive fallacies of the robot and the attitudes and personalities of the participants and should not be considered a single psychological construct."

        "description": "The conjunction and disjunction fallacies are expressions of irrational judgments. We propose a quantum cognition model that represents each concept as a separate qubit and the measurement process as a weak measurement. Using an on-line questionnaire, we analyzed the relation between irrational judgment and the corresponding quantum state entanglement. The model enables us to follow an individuals‚Äô quantum cognitive representation throughout the questionnaire and shows that, on average, participants get more entangled as they progress in the questionnaire. Our model accounts for multiple concepts simultaneously for rational and irrational decisions and suggests that quantum entanglement of mental concepts is correlated with irrational judgments."

In the first study, we explored a novel type of ranking presentation, namely, choosing between two rank orders of options. To enable a direct comparison of fallacy rates between free ranking and the new presentation mode, we calculated the frequencies of the two presented rank orders in a free ranking condition. Our analysis shows that people choose the non-fallacious rank order significantly more when asked to choose between two rank orders as compared to freely ranking the possible options. In a second study, we explored whether an agent presenting the rankings to choose from has an effect. To alleviate social biases we used videos of social robots as the presenting agents. We show that rank orders presented by social agents significantly reduce the fallacy rates, compared to rank orders presented without an agent. We discuss the results in view of social decision making theories, wherein a ranking presentation by a social agent is comparable to a consultation with another person regarding free ranking. Our results suggest that fallacious decision making can be mitigated by a social agent presenting rankings to choose from."

I think what makes a lot of our work and jobs is the personal connection, which I felt Nurit truly excelled at :) I look forward to cooperating more in the future, and have no doubt Variantyx would do many more amazing things, thanks to people like Nurit! All the best with a lot of appreciation!‚Äù",

I learned a lot from Nurit, especially how to create an efficient delivery life cycle, mitigate risks, resource management and planning. We built amazing interfaces. She is a team player and a leader, someone you want by your side on every challenge.‚Äù"

      "Viktoria Olesen ‚ÄúNetta is a truly impressive marketing professional and strategic thinker and it was a pleasure to work closely with her on all manners pipeline, marketing and strategy. It was of great value for us to be able to draw advantage not only from the examples from successful real-life campaigns and B2B marketing practices, but also quickly get playbooks up and running. Overall, Netta reduced a lot of my insecurities in prioritising my 'to-do' list and added a big load of backbone into the decisions made.‚Äù",
      "Nevo Alva ‚ÄúI've been working with Netta and the Blueseedling team for over 8 months. Having worked with several marketing teams in the past, I have a good perspective to say Blueseedling are one of the best teams I met. One of the things which is a great indicator to a good marketing team is how the engineering team feels about them, it is very rare to see an engineering team happy about the company's marketing, especially when the product (like ours) is for developers :) From day one, Blueseedling managed to extract the thoughts and information out of the management team and founders and turn them into strategy, positioning and messaging, which were and are solid building blocks for our marketing materials, website and the launch of our product. Last but not least, BS team are there when we need them, even when asked to help with product or sales which are not under their responsibility, no questions asked. I'm still a (happy) customer and will definitely work with BS in the future.‚Äù"

        "description": "Understanding speech depends on its segmentation into units, andprosody ‚Äì the tone, intonation and rhythm of speech ‚Äì is a crucial toolused by speakers for this purpose. This book provides a comprehensivedescription of the prosodic boundary patterns of spoken Israeli Hebrew(IH), by examining how Hebrew-speakers express sequences of utterancesusing a defined set of prosodic boundary tones. The study specificallyfocuses on the relationship between the syntagmatic and prosodic layersof spoken IH, thereby clarifying our understanding of the relationshipbetween prosodic form and its linguistic function. This interface is modeledas the \"speeCHain perspective\", which demonstrates the chaining of speechunits and the subsequent systematic linkage of syntactic units. The researchwas carried out on authentic IH everyday conversations, thus providing aunique contribution to present-day research. The analysis sheds light onthe overall study of prosodic patterning in speech, and should be useful tospeech scientists and speech technology engineers who may be consideringmodeling prosody in speech technologies."

      "Mike Telem ‚ÄúYanir joined our startup at a very early stage in its life and very early in his own career and was very simply our MVP. Extremely motivated and goal driven, super helpful and quick to improvise as needed, smart, hard working - and a very good friend. After we were acquired by a bigger company Yanir surprised me again when he was able to adjust to a new role and the corporate mentality, defined and optimized processes, pushed new initiatives and was a rock star in the bigger company too. Its one of those special people you very scarcely get to work with and never forget. Probably the best person I ever had working for me.‚Äù",
      "Chandana Kotha ‚ÄúYanir is an outstanding Technical Lead , very talented and passionate about customers success .

His energy and enthusiasm to help everyone around him is commendable .‚Äù"

He is very technical and highly motivated, always willing to help no matter the rank or the situation. These last two years working under Shaul are the years I learned the most in my career in WalkMe and have vastly helped me advance and improve.

Elad is always punctual, his knowledge is vast and extensive. Elad leads by example and many developers who worked with him, found his enthusiasm and dedication motivating. Elad was always dedicated and goal oriented that cannot be overestimated. Working with Elad, seeing his passion for CSS was truly inspiring.‚Äù",
      "Orit Lichtnaier-Gil ‚ÄúIn the year time i work with Elad i learned that he holds an amazing knowledge base in Front End Development. From a designer's perspective - Elad is a proffesional wet dream, because he's extremely creative and working with him mean almost everything is possible - Give him a design and he will not only find a way to do it - but it would be in the most clean and browser friendly fashion. On a personal level, Elad is also funny, friendly, and has a big heart. i love working with him!‚Äù"

We began working closely together in the global scaling phase of the Mooviter Community approximately 3.5 years ago. Since then Gaby was promoted and proved her amazing project management skills were transferable to team building and management; she makes leadership look effortless, challenging her team in the global operations team at Moovit to meet seemingly impossible deadlines and reach KPIs.

A usage of the electronic asset may be monitored using an activities agent installed on the electronic asset and the agent may monitor a power mode of the electronic asset and usage statistics. A policy may be defined at the server including a first inactivity condition that, when satisfied by the usage statistics of the electronic asset, results in a first alert being generated by the agent indicating inactivity of the electronic asset. The policy may be communicated from the server to the agent, and the agent may determine whether the inactivity condition is satisfied by comparing the usage statistics against the first inactivity condition.

It took 3 years to go over all the departments and to complete the role mining and certification processes. We have had an immediate ROI after starting with our service organization where bulks of employees join, go through courses and shift teams. From a very intensive manual labor of few employees in 3-4 teams, the process now takes minutes to complete and involves only 1 admin to complete 1 unmanaged system.A year later we see a much calmer and more efficient environment.But it requires a hand on the wheel to implement and manage the on-going operation."

      "Michael Crabtree ‚ÄúI absolutely enjoy working with Ohad for multiple reasons: 1. He understands what we're trying to do as a business, the objectives, projected outcomes, etc.; and he new knows how to write code to meet those needs. 2. As a lead he is constantly looking for ways to reduce complexity and improve speed using sound development fundamentals. He is listened to because his peers trust his judgement. 3. Ohad is an engineer who thinks like sales, biz dev, ad ops, etc. and the business makes decisions based on his input. He is well respected, trusted, and has always been considered a key player at AppThis. This combination of technical, analytical, and business-oriented thinking strengths is rare to find in engineers.‚Äù",
      "Michael Shaughnessy ‚ÄúOhad is among the very best software engineers I've had the privilege to work with. He is relentless, kind, extremely smart, and creative. He has a rare focus on providing value to his colleagues across the business, and uses his years of experience to full effect. He's the kind of developer who multiplies both the technical output and business outcomes just by being a part of the team. I owe Ohad a deep debt of gratitude for every time he's woken me up in the middle of night to let me know he's partway through fixing my broken systems. Our company owes him an even deeper for the hundreds of seemingly minor changes he makes, across our full stack, to make the system work better for out customers. He's the first person I'd trust to take care of any system I'm responsible for, and the first person I recommend my colleagues ask for help. Consider yourself lucky if you get to work with him in any capacity!‚Äù"

Her relationship building skills were unparalleled compared to her peer group. I look forward to working with Adi in the future.‚Äù",

When I told her our story, she immediately recognized where the potential was for our company, suggesting we focus and emphasize this in our pitch - specifically placing our success in China in the spotlight. I was impressed and amazed at how the small tips which affect the \"here and now\" decisions can later change a whole strategy of a company.‚Äù"

Although Baruchi had relatively little Java experience he quickly became fluent in the language and with the system which is very extensive and quite complex. Baruchi developed new modules, mostly dealing with speech recognition and processing. His unique knowledge in this field was crucial to our product and he delivered stable, high performance speech processing modules. In addition he developed language processing and GUI components that were always reliable and well written. Baruchi is a fast learner, goal oriented software developer that functions well within a team and also independently.

She understands how to align sales, marketing, and operations with technology and cross-functional collaboration. We need more leaders like Leore to carry the industry forward. She cares about others, is selfless with her time, and constantly innovating in the new arena of RevOps!‚Äù",
      "Scott Lorenson ‚ÄúProfessionally, Leore was extremely impactful on my time at Anodot, specifically within the Salesforce universe. She used her knowledge and talent to build a CRM operation that was instrumental in producing high-quality meeting flow, lead progression, and opportunity management visibility. The system she architected was deployed globally and was the reporting foundation ‚Äúone source of truth‚Äù not only for my Sales Development team but for the entire organization: sales, marketing, and finance. Personally, she has a positive attitude and was a pleasure to be around! Even though we were 10hrs apart, she would always make herself available for me or any member of my team regardless of time. Leore was my ‚Äúgo-to person‚Äù and I personally would not have been anywhere near as successful as I was if it weren‚Äôt for her! ‚Äù"

        "date": "February 28, 2022",
        "description": "Basketball is one of the most popular types of sports in theworld. Recent technological developments have made it possible to collect large amounts of data on the game, analyze it, and discover new insights. We propose a novel approach for modeling basketball games using deep reinforcement learning. By analyzing multiple aspects of both the players andthe game, we are able to model the latent connections among players‚Äô movements, actions, and performance, into a single measure ‚Äì the Q-Ball. Using Q-Ball, we are able to assignscores to the performance of both players and whole teams. Our approach has multiple practical applications, including evaluating and improving players‚Äô game decisions and producing tactical recommendations. We train and evaluate our approach on a large dataset of National Basketball Association games, and show that the Q-Ball is capable of accurately assessing the performance of players and teams. Furthermore, we show that Q-Ball is highly effective in recommending alternatives to players‚Äô actions."

        "subtitle": "UMAP-2018",
        "date": "July 8, 2018",
        "description": "Inferring socio-demographic attributes of users is an essential and challenging task that could help with personalization, recommendation, advertising, etc. Sensor data collected from mobile devices can be utilized for inferring such attributes. Previous works have focused on combining different types of sensors, such as applications, accelerometers, GPS, batteries, and many others, on achieving this task. In this study, we were able to infer attributes, such as gender, age, marital status, and whether the user has children, using solely the GPS sensor. We suggest a novel inference technique, which learns an embedding representation of preprocessed spatial GPS trajectories using an adaption of the Word2vec approach. Based on the embedding representation, we later train multiple classification models to achieve the inference goals. Our empirical results indicate that the suggested embedding approach outperforms a classification approach that does not take into consideration the embedding patterns. Experiments on real datasets collected from Android devices show that the proposed method achieves over 80% accuracy for various demographic prediction tasks."

      "Tzlil Ashkenazi ‚ÄúI have being mentored by Zoe as part of 'Baot - finding the next job' program. Her expertise in frontend technologies and understanding of industry trends helped me identify and focus on learning the most relevant skills. Zoe provided tailored guidance, helping me overcome weaknesses and providing invaluable insights into how to effectively communicate and present my projects during interviews. I highly recommend Zoe to anyone seeking career advancement in frontend development.‚Äù",
      "Yael Luria ‚ÄúZoe mentored me as part of the ‚ÄúFinding your Next Job‚Äù Mentorship program of the \"Baot\" community. I started my job search in June 2020, the height of the covid-19 world crisis. Being a self-taught developer with no professional experience and no formal education in the field this was not simple at all and I barely received any interview invitations. The meetings with Zoe on a weekly basis, helped me organize my job search, and prepare for interviews. We practiced solving algorithms and interview questions, as well as mock home assignments. Additionally, Zoe reviewed the code on my portfolio projects and helped me practice presenting them. These meetings were very important to me and helped boost my confidence, and not lose hope in this very tough period of time for me. Within a few months, I started getting invited to considerably more interviews and reached the final stages in several interview processes before accepting a position at an amazing company. I learned a lot from Zoe‚Äôs approach to thinking about code and problem-solving. She‚Äôs an extremely nice and patient person with a great sense of humor (If I had done badly in an interview that week there was a bright side to it because I knew I could laugh with Zoe about it later). Her devotion and commitment to helping women succeed in tech is impressive and inspiring and I will be forever grateful for her help. ‚Äù"

I've had the privilege of witnessing Chen unwavering enthusiasm, problem-solving abilities, and strong work ethic. His approach challenges with a unique blend of technical expertise and a sincere desire to create meaningful change. I have no doubt that Chen will continue to excel both professionally and personally, and I wholeheartedly recommend them as someone who brings dedication and integrity to everything he do.‚Äù",

Really, he actually got the whole deal. He always likes sharing his vast experience with us, his colleagues, and just as his name suggests - he's graceful and usually smiling. He is self-motivating, and others around him, to initiate, to create, and above all ‚Äì to give. I'm not familiar with anything like his baby, @Sonmit, anywhere around the globe - and I think even higher of him since he launched it, though I couldn't believe that's even possible.‚Äù"
